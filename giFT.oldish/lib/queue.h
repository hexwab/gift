/**
 * @file queue.h
 *
 * @brief Non-blocking socket write queue
 *
 * Queues up socket writes and waits for either a manual \ref queue_flush or
 * if you are using the event.h systems it will automatically write the data
 * when the supplied socket is able to be written to.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * \code
 * static int write_func (Connection *c, char *packet, void *udata)
 * {
 *    printf ("sending '%s'...\n", packet);
 *    net_send (c->fd, packet, 0);
 *
 *    // returning TRUE indicates that you wish this queued block to be
 *    // handles once more.  very useful if you are trying to send a file
 *    // over a socket this way.
 *    return FALSE;
 * }
 *
 * static int destroy_func ()
 * {
 *    // we dont need a special deallocator
 *    return FALSE;
 * }
 *
 * List *list = NULL;
 *
 * list = list_append (list, "packet1");
 * list = list_append (list, "packet2");
 * list = list_append (list, "packet3");
 *
 * queue_add (c, (QueueWriteFunc) write_func, (QueueWriteFunc) destroy_func,
 *            list, NULL);
 * // queue_flush would cause all entries to be written right now, or
 * // normally the event system will takeover and write them when able to.
 * \endcode
