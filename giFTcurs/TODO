A realistic TODO list for giFTcurs
==================================

Stuff that's planned:
	* Hilight new transfers.
	* Ability to tag search results and perform an action on all tagged ones.
	* Ability to search on meta data.
	* Ability to choose filename for downloads.
	* Documentation. (info page, faq)
	* A screen where you browse users.
	* A screen where you see the log, maybe chat could be here as well.
	* Numbered links, as in lynx (Like say you move on page down with
		space and then you see foobar.ogg as entry 39 and
		you press 3 and 9 and then enter) (wish from b0ef)
	* UTF-8 support.
	* Move away from glib's logging facility, since it has a stupid buffer
	  that is 1025 bytes in size. We need more.

Stuff that we'll probably never get to, but would be sort of nice:
	* World domination and so on.
	* Client to client chat.
	* Use readline(3) for the input fields.

Never forget, we must fight the feature creep!
