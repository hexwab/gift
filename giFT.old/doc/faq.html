   <li><b>What is giFT?</b><br>
giFT is a plugin system that can be used to connect to many different
networks. But for now OpenFT is the only network you can use.

   <li><b>History</b><br>
Development to create a Linux client to KaZaA was our initial goal. After a
lot of reverse engineering and packet sniffing, a group of talented developers
which became known as &quot;the givers&quot; stumbled onto our project (at the
time &quot;kazaatux&quot;). Within a few weeks, we had a working daemon that
could connect to and search the KaZaA network. Shortly after, KaZaA released a
new version of their client which eventually led to the breaking of what we
now call giFT. After the permanent departure of the givers, the giFT team
started moving development into a new direction; foremost was the desire to
have a completely open, completely free peer to peer network modeled in the
image of FastTrack. Thus OpenFT was born. giFT was moved to a new plugin
architecture which would allow the creation of plugins that would make it easy
for one client to be compatible with any number of networks. The first of
these plugins were to be OpenFT, and a reimplementation of a working FastTrack
client.
   </li><br>
   <li><b>Why use a daemon?</b><br>
It creates an easy way for people to focus their time on frontends instead of
all of so much networking code. Also, if the daemon changes, all of the
frontends will still function the same as they had before. This also makes it
so we don&#39;t end up with 20 incompatible protocols flying around as 
standalone clients.

   <li><b>How can I help speed up development?</b><br>
You can&#39;t. Well... maybe you can help testing, or make your box available
as a search node. Just drop into our IRC channel and ask if you can do 
something.</li><br>
   <li><b>Front-end Developers</b><br>
See the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=9382&group_id=34618">Interface Protocol Documentation</a>
   </li><br>
   <li><b>Will giFT be ported to any other hosts?</b><br>
When the system is stable on Linux/x86, porting to other structures will most
likely ensue soon after. But if you would like to experiment with the current
code, you&#39;re more than welcome. Please report it to our IRC channel if you
are successful.

 <a name="ft"><!-- FASTTRACK --></a>
 <li><font size=+1><b>KaZaa, Morpheus, Grokster, oh my!</b></font><br><br>
  <ul>
   <li><b>What is this &quot;FastTrack&quot;?</b><br>
FastTrack is the company that licenses the library that
KaZaA/Morpheus/Grokster operates off of.
   </li><br>
   <li><b>Why can&#39;t I connect to KaZaA/Morpheus/Grokster anymore?</b><br>
The encryption has changed, thanks to FastTrack. We have been unable to 
reverse engineer it as of yet.
   </li><br>
   <li><b>But I could connect to FastTrack with giFT 0.9.7!</b><br>
When version 1.3.3 of KaZaA was released, it contained a &quot;Security
Update&quot; which broke our implementation.
   </li><br>
   <li><b>Are you working on getting back into FastTrack&#39;s network?</b><br>
Not actively, no. Although quite a few people made attempts to reverse
engineer the new encryption, nobody has succeeded, and AFAIK nobody is working
on it atm.
   </li><br>
   <li><b>What about KaZaA&#39;s Linux client?</b><br>
   After KaZaA moved it became unavailable and the old versions can't connect anymore... whatever, it sucked anyway :)
   </li><br>
  </ul>
 </li>
 
 <a name="oft"><!-- OPENFT --></a>
 <li><font size=+1><b>OpenFT</b></font><br><br>
  <ul>
   <li><b>What&#39;s this OpenFT I&#39;ve been hearing about?</b><br>
It&#39;s an Open Source ``clone&#39;&#39; of FastTrack currenty being worked
on by the giFT project.  We welcome anyone with decentralized/p2p experience
to drop by and poke around at our design.
   </li><br>
   <li><b>Oh, cool, where can I check OpenFT out?</b><br>
You can &#39;check it out&#39; of CVS with these commands:<br><br>
<tt>
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gift.sf.net:/cvsroot/gift co giFT<br>
cd giFT<br>
./autogen.sh --enable-maintainer-mode<br>
make<br>
su -c &#39;make install&#39;<br>
giFT<br>
</tt>
   </li><br>
   <li><b>Erm... I would like some more info on installing giFT/OpenFT</b><br>
Read the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=9573&group_id=34618">Installation guide</a>
   </li><br>
   <li><b>It just sits there, how the heck do I search for stuff?</b><br>
You need a GUI, doh! :) There are a few GUI&#39;s available ATM,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=9573&group_id=34618">Installation guide</a>
lists them all. Note: The thing that &quot;just sits there&quot; must be 
running at all times.
   </li><br>
   <li><b>How come I can&#39;t find stuff?</b><br>
The network (OpenFT) is still being developed. But, with your help and word of
mouth, when the network is in a usable state, we&#39;ll take over where KaZaA
left off, and eventually bury them in the dirt. Make sure you share _your_
stuff!
   </li><br>
   <li><b>Is OpenFT eventually going to use features like metadata?</b><br>
Yes, eventually. It needs to stabalize first before all sorts of fancy
features will be added.

 <li><font size=+1><b>ShadowFT</b></font><br><br>
  <ul>
   <li><b>I heard something about something called ShadowFT, what is it?</b><br>
It&#39;s a program that lets you &#39;search&#39; for files on the FT network.
   </li><br>
   <li><b>Cool, where can I get it?</b><br>
<a href="http://www.dddi.nl/~costar/shadowFT">http://www.dddi.nl/~costar/shadowFT</a>
   </li><br>
   <li><b>It&#39;s neat, how is it doing that? I thought the encryption was changed. How come you guys can&#39;t do this?</b><br>
It doesn&#39;t really connect to the supernodes or central server. You may
notice that the real KaZaA client doesn&#39;t sit there and scan for IPs for a
few hours before you can search. What this program does is scan a ton of IPs
for an open port 1214 and uses the KaZaA built in web server
(http://server:1214 in browser) to get a list of currently available files,
and puts them into a database that it lets you search through locally. Which
can explain why alot of times your downloads will fail to even start. Check
out the README file with ShadowFT to figure out how to maximize the programs 
uses.
