# within will be subjected to an MD5 hashing.  The results will be cached and
# will only be recalculated on a per share basis when the size or
# modification time in the cache and on disk disagree, or the file name is
# changed.
#
# Sanity notice:
#  Do NOT share source directories!  Remote nodes will refuse to index your
#  shares if you are attempting to submit more than 64000 files.
#
# Security notice:
#  Do not share directories which may contain sensitive information, such as
#  ~ ($HOME).  Also note that any directories shared here will be stripped of
#  all but the last path element when submitted to other nodes for indexing,
#  effectively "hiding" the directory prefix.
#
# Windows users: please use the following path specification:
#
# /[drive]/dir1/dir2:/[drive]/dir3/dir4 ...

# should be able to assist you there.

[main]

#
# Node classification.  This value is very important and will determine your
# potential role on the network.  The following settings are allowed:
#
# 1  (USER)
#
#  Basic class that all nodes implicitly belong to.  This node will maintain
#  very few TCP connections on the network and perform almost no tasks other
#  than to upload to other users.  Users who do not have direct Internet
#  connections will be forced into this class.
#
# 3  (SEARCH)
#
#  Responsible for manging indexes of a large group of directly connected
#  children (run-time modifier for the USER class), responding to and
#  forwarding search requests from peers, as well as directing push requests
#  so that indirectly connected users may still share files.
#
#  Please note that this class will require a much greater amount of both
#  local and network resources.  If you select this, pay very close attention
#  to the database environment settings several configuration options down.
#  For reference, there are several fully functioning search nodes on
#  "average" broadband connections, such as 768/128kbit (my node *sigh*).
#
#  Keeping your node up-to-date is absolutely essential for this node class.
#  Please consider updating at least once a week.
#
# 5  (INDEX)
#
#  Meta node used in favor of user nodes when attempting new connections to
#  the network.  This node class is also responsible for managing statistics
#  information for the virtual clusters created by SEARCH nodes.  Reliability
#  is the largest requirement here.
#
# If you're unsure it is highly recommended that you select 1 (the default).
# A setting of 7 will select both a SEARCH and INDEX node.
#
class = 1

#
# Core listening port.  OpenFT uses a compacted binary protocol for the core
# communication with other nodes.  If this machine is unable to provide both
# port and http_port to the outside directly (blocked by either by a firewall
# or a NAT setup) you should select 0 here.
#
# NOTE:
#  If you are unable to route this port (along with the HTTP port) you will be
#  unable to download from other users with that same inability.  You will,
#  however, maintain the ability to upload to other non-firewalled users.
#  Selecting non-zero when the port is not available to the outside will cause
#  very broken behaviour, namely search results will be extremely unreliable.
#

#
# NOTE:

# WARNING:
#  Specifications less than 500MB (and we expect you will specify less than

# NOTE:
#  This switch provides a very crude loophole that could allow you to create
