This project is not closed to developers contributing, however the maintainer
is very very anal about design and style.  I strongly suggest you clear
absolutely all design changes with him prior to hacking and absolutely never
write code with a different style (unless you wish to anger the beast ;)

Please send your patches to gift-openft@lists.sourceforge.net.

Here are a few basic style guidelines that _MUST_ be followed before getting
CVS write access.

 * Absolutely _NO_ trailing whitespace of any kind
 * \t's _ONLY_ for indentation.  Any formatting after the leading whitespace
   MUST be with spaces only.  If your code doesn't format exactly how jasta
   likes it with his tab stops, you'll be shot on spot :)
 * Whitespace before __EVERY__ begin parenthesis.  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
 * Braces must always be on the line following the statement/declaration.  No
   K&R.
 * End braces must have an extra blank line following them _if_ the next
   character is beginning a statement.  Example:

	if (this)
	{
		test ();
		bla ();
	}

	statement ();

    - or -

	for (;;)
	{
		if (this)
		{
			test ();
			bla ();
		}
	}


 * Avoid using { } when the if conditional has only one line of code following
   it.  If you wish to comment the code or otherwise require more than one
   line, you must always use braces.
 * Never use more than one \n consecutively.  This is very annoying.
 * And lastly, just look at the rest of the code!  If yours is noticably
   different, change it!

If your code is not formatted correctly, please use indent to clean it up (the
.indent.pro's are located in src, lib, and OpenFT).  This seems to come the
closest to format code to our requirements.  Please note that indent is only
to do the rough cleanup -- you may actually undo some of the custom formatting
jasta likes.
