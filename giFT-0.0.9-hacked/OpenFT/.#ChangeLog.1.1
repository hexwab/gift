OpenFT 0.0.9-1:

   * Major high-level redesign begun.  Initial changes include the formation
     of virtual clusters through a configurable number of static peer search
     node connections.  Searches are broadcasted to all peers, which then
     rebroadcast the search until TTL expires, or the maximum result set is
     reached.  Several optimizations are planned to improve efficiency in a
     large scale network.

   * Migrated the code over to the new logging facilities provided through the
     Protocol structure.

OpenFT 0.0.8-2:

   * More improvements to the search database design.  We are now utilizing a
     single database environment and all child shares are inserted into the
     same physical file on disk.

   * Tested and [almost] finished direct browsing.  Currently,
     ft_packet_sendto is limited to only being able to deliver packets to
     non-firewalled users.  Hopefully this will be addressed soon.

OpenFT 0.0.8-1:

   * Massive scalability improvements related to the search node database code
     which organizes and indexes all child shares.  For the more technical of
     our audience, we have moved to a database design utilizing two master
     databases for all searching requirements (greatly increasing insert and
     removal overhead) while reducing the number of file descriptors open at
     any one time and total memory overhead.

   * Rewrote node, network organization, and connection subsystems for OpenFT.
     While it has little effect on the network structure directly, I will
     begin to utilize these new APIs through implementation of node
     clustering.  Honestly, it's coming soon :)

   * Untested "fix" for direct user browsing.  See 0.0.7-8's entry for more
     details on this.

OpenFT 0.0.7-8:

   * Direct browsing implemented.  Please note that this code will currently
     only work if you already have an OpenFT connection with the user you are
     browsing.  This limitation is strictly client-side and should be
     considered a "bug".  Will be fixed ASAP.

OpenFT 0.0.7-7:

   * Fixed session handshaking...I know, shut up.

OpenFT 0.0.7-6:

   * Fixed session handshaking for real this time...I promise.

OpenFT 0.0.7-5:

   * Fixed a bug which ignored the need to test supplied ports.  This caused
     nodes which have been improperly configured (port = non-zero yet it is
     not remotely accessable, likely because of a firewall) to report as
     non-firewalled users and reply with a URL as such.  It would thus be
     impossible to download from these users.

   * Fixed a somewhat related bug which caused session handshaking to
     prematurely complete.  Fixing this bug causes a minor disruption in
     handshaking with 0.0.7-4, which worsens the race condition in 0.0.7-4.

OpenFT 0.0.7-4:

   * Deliver node aliases over HTTP and display appropriately for uploads
     registered this way.

OpenFT 0.0.7-3:

   * Fixed a minor endianness problem when communicating IPv4 addresses over
     OpenFT.

OpenFT 0.0.7-2:

   * Public "release" of OpenFT 0.0.7.

OpenFT 0.0.7-1:

   * Transparent stream compression over OpenFT.  This system introduces a
     a bandwidth optimization which greatly reduces the number of OpenFT
     packets required for writing (by blocking multiple writes into one packet)
     as well as transparently compressing the writes with ZLIB if available.
     Currently, the non-zlib code is somewhat broken so ZLIB is a requirement.
     This will be lifted soon.

   * Strict protocol "handshaking" stage requiring all nodes deliver the
     required information/packet responses before the stage increases and the
     true OpenFT session begins.

   * Completely removed old method of browsing due to a severe waste of
     resources by design.  A new direct browse method which operates over
     OpenFT using stream compression is expected to be completed shortly.

OpenFT <= 0.0.6:

   * Information lost.
