giFTcurs - a curses frontend to giFT
====================================

Installation
------------

 To compile giFTcurs you need to have the development package for ncurses
installed. When you've untarred the sources, cd into the giFTcurs
directory and type:
    ./configure
    make
    su
    make install

 If things went well you should be able to run giFTcurs and connect to
the giFT daemon. If you don't have giFT, look at http://giFT.sf.net/.

 Currenly giFTcurs only works with the CVS version of giFT. This is because
the daemon protocol changes frequently. If things don't work then maybe
you need to get a newer version of giFTcurs, http://giFTcurs.sf.net/.

 For more information, see giFTcurs(1) and giFTcurs.conf(5).

Bug Reporting
-------------

 First read http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html, if you
haven't already. You can get debug output from giFTcurs if you redirect
stderr, i.e.:
    $ giFTcurs -v 2>debug.out

 Also make sure the bug still exists in the CVS version of giFTcurs. Run
this command to get the CVS source:
    cvs -z3 -d \
    :pserver:anonymous@cvs.giftcurs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/giftcurs \
    co giFTcurs
Then whenever you want to update the source, just run "cvs -z3 up -Pd"
in the giFTcurs directory. To compile giFTcurs from CVS you must have the
GNU autotools (automake, autoconf), the ncurses headers and gettext. A
fairly recent (think 0.10.40) version of gettext is required, since we use
ngettext. With some distributions you'll need the package gettext-devel
as well. To compile type this:
    ./autogen.sh
    make
    su
    make install

 When you have your bug report finished submit it to the right tracker at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/giftcurs/.

 Or just ignore this and complain in #giFT on irc.openprojects.net. This
is actually what most people do for some reason. I guess this README
looks like a file that must not be read to them.


Portability
-----------

 giFTcurs has been known to work (at one time or another) with the following
systems:
	Debian GNU/Linux 3.0, NetBSD 1.5.2, Debian GNU/Hurd, OpenBSD 3.0, AIX,
	SunOS/Solaris, Mac OS X, Tru64 (OSF1 V4.0), FreeBSD 4.4 and cygwin.
Patches/suggestions which fix portability issues are highly appreciated.
