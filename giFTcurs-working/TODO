A realistic TODO list for giFTcurs
==================================

Stuff that's planned:
	* Ability to choose filename for downloads.
	* Documentation.

Stuff that we'll probably never get to, but would be sort of nice:
	* World domination and so on.
	* Client to client chat.
	* Use readline(3) for the input fields.

Never forget, we must fight the feature creep!
