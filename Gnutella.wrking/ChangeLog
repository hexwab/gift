Gnutella 0.0.10:

    * Support Vendor Messages.

    * Support ConnectBack vendor message for better firewalled status
      detection.

    * Slightly improved the random number seed.

    * Send an empty error page when the remote side supports queueing.

    * All searches now timeout after at most 10 minutes.

    * Only use the full http:// URL in GWebcache requests when using a proxy
      (see RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1) for further information).

    * Support outgoing compression of message streams.

    * Drop "urn:" trailer from queries sent.

    * Send full filename in PUSH uploads; seems LimeWire requires it.

    * Support p->share_hide/show for hiding shares from other nodes with
      a HopsFlow message, allowing them to be efficiently un/re-shared.

    * Basic support for sending GGEP blocks.

    * Change "really-old" auto-deactivation to silent failure to avoid
      creating surprises for people who don't care.

    * Support push proxies:  put a GGEP block containing the IP address of
      some servers we're connected to in order to improve upload performance
      of firewalled nodes.

    * Ban webcaches that resolve to local IP addresses.

Gnutella 0.0.9.2:

    * Fix file descriptor leak in file_cache.c that's been around for a while
      but was made worse by syncing the nodes files every so often.

    * Don't potentially poll the CPU if the remote zlib stream is called with
      Z_FINISH.

Gnutella 0.0.9.1:

    * Remove checking for -lresolv in configure.

Gnutella 0.0.9:

    * Fix compile problem with 0.0.8 on big-endian platforms.

    * Deactivate the plugin if it's more than one year old.

    * Close all searches when plugin is unloaded.

Gnutella 0.0.8:

    * Trim the node list every so often to prevent it from growing unbounded.

    * Fix leak of GtNode on incoming connects.

    * No longer reply to queries marked with the same GUID.

    * Fix bug in GWebCache code where replies got discarded, as well as
      some miscellaneous bugs in GWebCache code, and ban caches that
      fail DNS lookups.

    * Updated list of GWebCaches.

    * Fix metadata parsing bugs where the metadata was discarded.

    * Removed questionably-bad hosts from ban-list.

    * Support new Source URL format: Gnutella:?ip=..&port=...

    * Timeout push requests to monopolize Chunks less so that Chunks
      will get trapped on inactive Sources less often.

    * Shorter connection timeout to monopolize Chunks less.

Gnutella 0.0.7:

    * Fix a compile error caused by bad prototype in a header file.

    * Use a different method for calculating the number of files/total
      bytes shared. Some samples around the median of many pongs are taken
      instead of just using the average of many pongs.

    * Ban downloaders for IP addresses in hostiles.txt and incorporate
      ban list from peer guardian.

Gnutella 0.0.6:

    * Support receive-side decompression of node streams (transmit-side
      compression still unimplemented).

    * Source searching re-enabled.

    * Preliminary support for parsing XML metadata from packets that
      have them (usually from LimeWire or Shareaza) using libxml. Support
      is disabled by default and needs --with-libxml passed to configure
      to enable.

    * Keep track of file sizes/file count statistics from pongs, and
      approximate the number on the network (very haphazardly, I
      might add).

    * Fix a potential assert failure when shares are removed.

    * Fix bug where malformed incoming connection requests would
      cause CPU polling.

    * Incrementally build a larger query-routing table until the fill
      ratio is 1%. Reduces bandwidth used a bit.

    * Support active-queueing.

    * Fix parsing of bitprint urns.

Gnutella 0.0.5:

    * Don't reply to our own search requests.

    * Fix display of the time to retry when the peer we
      download from supplies Retry-After:

    * Fix severe mistake in request parsing that caused almost
      all uploads to fail.

    * Remove access.log support, as it has a tendency to consume
      too much disk space when small chunks get requested.

Gnutella 0.0.4:

    * Download unpausing would crash giftd. Fix it.

    * Support requests by hpath (/audio/blah/) as well since its
      not too much extra code to support and useful sometimes.

    * Compression was not enabled in configure script, enabled it.

    * Firewalled nodes that did searches would accept results from
      nodes with private IPs. Fixed.

    * Maintain a banlist of gwebcaches and add any gwebcaches
      that return anything but 200-series responses.

    * Fixed Retry-After.

Gnutella 0.0.3:

    * Add a node cache to store nodes learned from pongs and X-Try-Ultrapeer:
      With this, connecting to the network should be much less ad-hoc. Also,
      returns such nodes in X-Try-Ultrapeer: header for other nodes.

    * Access the gwebcaches on demand, rather then when the
      number of nodes is arbitrarily low.

    * Use 4-bit QRP patches. Still needs to do incremental updates, though.

    * Send "206 Partial Content" replies to partial requests instead of
      "200 OK".

    * Support Retry-After: header.

    * Basic static stats that assumes the network has no cycles.

    * Only send requests by file index, rather than uri-res requests,
      if the previous uri-res request failed or the connection closed
      abruptly. Previously, they were sent randomly. Also, send these
      requests without url encoding, as that is more compatible.

    * Update HTTP transfer size after we receive a GIV response, as
      giFT could change the size of a download request while we wait
      for a response from the firewalled servent.

Gnutella 0.0.2:

    * 0.0.1 would access the gwebcaches excessively due to an oversight
      that the nodes retrieved from them aren't stored because they
      have a vitality of 0. So, this increase in the release number should
      help identifying problem behaviour between releases.

      Unfortunately, this adds a new problem in that a completely stale nodes
      file will keep us from connecting. This needs a redesign to access the
      caches if we've exhausted all other options.

    * Much improved search timeout system that will detect when
      no more results for a search are likely to come back. Still need to
      check if any results are dropped, though.

    * Fix leak of TCPC objects for persistent connections.

    * Temporarily disabled locate requests because they need some kind
      of global queue to limit the rate at which they are produced.

Gnutella 0.0.1:

    * Persistent HTTP support.

    * Eliminated most races between download_stop and push downloads.
      There is still the possiblity of the remote end aborting the connection
      before we giFT reissues a download_start request, but that can't be
      fixed without protocol-initiated downloads.

    * Submit query-routing table of local shares to ultrapeers.

    * Support for using an http proxy to access the gwebcaches (set
      "http/proxy" key in ~/.giFT/Gnutella/Gnutella.conf).

    * Testable, but unstable Ultrapeer mode.

    * Forgot to report 'Connecting' status when initiating a download.

    * Added ChangeLog.

    * Use a trie for storing the local shares database to improve
      lookup time. Memory usage still needs investigation.

Gnutella 0.0.0:

    * Basic support for searching, downloading, and uploading.
