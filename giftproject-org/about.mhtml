<h2>What is giFT?</h2>

<p>
	giFT is a collection of various
	<a href="/software/">software components</a>
	geared towards improving the overall usability of a multitude of
	peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.  This goal is accomplished by
	unifying the components such that a user of the software may choose
	any of the <a href="/software/guis.mhtml">available interfaces</a> to
	access any of
	the <a href="software/plugins.mhtml">available networks</a>.  The
	central application,
	<a href="software/core.mhtml"><span class="comp">giftd</span></a>,
	uses a plugin-based architecture capable of using multiple networks
	simultaneously through a single user interface.
</p>

<p>
	The giFT project represents the group of software developers
	responsible for the creation of the core giFT components and the
	overall system's design.
	Several <a href="/software/">third party</a> projects have sprouted
	up to expand the system as a whole, providing a wider selection of
	<a href="software/guis.mhtml">user interfaces</a> and
	<a href="software/plugins.mhtml">network plugins</a>.
</p>

<h2>Target Platforms</h2>

<p>
	giFT was developed on GNU/Linux using the C programming language with
	portability in mind.  Unfortunately, most user interfaces were
	designed only to work on specific platforms, usually due to
	limitations in the various GUI frameworks that are available.  While
	<span class="comp">giftd</span> itself should work on just about any
	conceivable platform, the following are known to provide robust
	environments for the system as a whole:
</p>

<ul title="Supported Operating Systems">
	<li>Microsoft Windows-based operating systems</li>
	<li>Mac OS X</li>
	<li>GNU/Linux</li>
	<li>BSD-based platforms</li>
	<li>AmigaOS</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Refer to the <a href="/software/">software section</a> of the page
	for specifics on the software available for each platform.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
	giFT supports just about every major feature you'd expect to see in
	any reasonably sophisticated file-sharing client, however we feel it
	necessary to brag about specifics anyway:
</p>

<ul id="features" title="Supported features">
	<li>
		"Swarmed" downloads (the ability to download a single file from
		multiple peers simultaneously)
	</li>
	<li>Access to multiple networks</li>
	<li>Centralized and scriptable interface</li>
	<li>Bandwidth throttling (rate limiting, upload queues, etc)</li>
	<li>Truly pluggable architecture</li>
	<li><a href="/download.mhtml">Freely distributed source code</a></li>
	<li>Extremely portable</li>
</ul>
