			This is the central component for the giFT framework.
			<span class="comp">giftd</span> is responsible for loading and
			executing network plugins, handling the remote interface
			protocol, managing searches, file exchanges, and other critical
			activities that exist above the network protocols themselves.
			In other words, <span class="comp">giftd</span> is the giFT
			work horse.

		<dd>
			Support and utility library for <span class="comp">giftd</span>
			and giFT network plugins.  This library is essentially a 
			grab bag of tools, data structures, and common functionality
			needed by, and found in, most large C projects.  While it is
			only critical for <span class="comp">giftd</span>, it can be
			a very useful tool to aid in developing user interfaces and
			other giFT-related utilities.  The source is heavily documented
			with the <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">doxygen</a> tool
			format.
