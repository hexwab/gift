<h2>How to contact the staff?</h2>

<p>
	We strongly encourage users and fellow developers from the community to get
	in touch with the giFT staffers, however we would ask that you carefully
	choose your forum before posting questions or puzzles for discussion.
</p>

<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>

<dl>

	<li>
		<dt>
			<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gift-users">gift-users</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Discussion forum for regular giFT users (simple bug reports are
			acceptable here).  Generally speaking, if you don't know C, aren't
			planning on making contributions to the project, or do
			not know how to use gdb (or some other capable debugger), you should
			probably post here.  We will attempt to staff some user-friendly
			admins willing to help you through some of the more basic giFT
			problems.
		</dd>
	</li>

	<li>
		<dt>
			<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gift-devel">gift-devel</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This list is reserved for complex technical discussions specifically
			about giFT (as opposed to OpenFT).  This list also serves as the
			notification address for tracker changes on the sourceforge.net
			project page and as such can be considered moderately high traffic.
		</dd>
	</li>

	<li>
		<dt>
			<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gift-openft">gift-openft</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Similar to gift-devel, except that discussion here is related
			specifically to the OpenFT protocol.
		</dd>
	</li>

	<li>
		<dt>
			gift-gnutella
		</dt>
		<dd>
			This list does not presently exist, but ought to.  Bug the developers
			if you'd like to see it created.
		</dd>
	</li>

</dl>

<h3>Sourceforge.net Modules</h3>

<dl>

	<li>
		<dt>
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=34618&atid=411725">Bug Tracker</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Bug management/tracking system provided by sourceforge.net.
You should note that this is not directly read by the core
giFT developers, it is instead filtered by some of the
less programmatic-inclined staffers.  More complex bugs
may take a while longer to get noticed by the people who
can actually fix them.
		</dd>
	</li>

	<li>
		<dt>
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=34618&atid=411727">Patches</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Similar to the bug tracker, but specifically designed to manage
			user-supplied patches.  Make sure you read README.dev (can be found in
			CVS) before submitting patches.   
		</dd>
	</li>

	<li>
		<dt>
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=108384">Public Forum</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Open discussion forum for the giFT project.  This is very rarely
			frequented by the core developers as most of the posts here appear to
			be quite miscellaneous.  If none of the other contact methods seem
			appropriate, try this one but keep in mind that your post may go
			unanswered for very long periods of time
		</dd>
	</li>

</dl>

<h3>Direct Contact</h3>

<ul>

	<li>
		<dt>
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=34618">Developers</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Each individual developer is listed here and their direct email
			contact information.  You should probably avoid using these if any of
			the above contact channels seem more appropriate.
		</dd>
	</li>

	<li>
		<dt>
			<a href="http://www.freenode.net">IRC</a> (irc.freenode.net:#gift)
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Last but not least is our somewhat private IRC channel.  Please please
			please <em>please</em> read the above methods before contacting us
			here.  This channel is ONLY used for direct development-oriented
			communication with the core developers and possibly some of the other
			staff members.  If you are interested in helping with development,
			just want to idly listen to jasta's insane ramblings, or you have some
			topic of conversation that is much easier addressed in real-time, you
			should use this channel.  Please, <em>no</em> basic support questions.
		</dd>
	</li>

</ul>
