This is a windows DLL wrapper around the platform independent ares library.

For the DLL interface and theory of operation please see aresdll.h.

To build the DLL follow the instructions in README.win32 at the root of this
repository.

The \test subdirectory contains a simple application written in Delphi for
testing the DLL.
