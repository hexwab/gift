---------------------

This is an Ares (www.aresgalaxy.org) plugin for giFT
(www.giftproject.org).


Compilation & Installation
--------------------------

Needed tools to build giFT-Ares are as follows:

automake    >= 1.6 (not if you use the tarball release)
autoconf    >= 2.5 (not if you use the tarball release)
libtool     >= 1.4 (not if you use the tarball release)
pkg-config
giFT


Next run './configure' in the top source dir if you are using a TARBALL RELEASE.
Or run './autogen.sh' if you got the sources from CVS.

If you have giFT installed in a non-standard location (according to
pkg-config), you must make sure that PKG_CONFIG_PATH is set to the
directory where libgift.pc is located.

For example:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" (for bash)
or
  setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH "/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig" (for tcsh)


The next step is to run 'make' and 'make install' which will compile
and install the plugin.

Then add Ares to the [main]/plugins line in ~/.giFT/gift.conf,
like so:

old:
	[main]
	plugins = OpenFT:Gnutella

new:
	[main]
	plugins = OpenFT:Gnutella:Ares

You may also use a fully qualified path to the plugin filename:
 
	[main]
	plugins = OpenFT:/usr/local/lib/giFT/libAres.la
 
The plugin will copy the configuration files from the
$PREFIX/share/giFT/Ares/ directory if necessary.


Running Ares behind a NAT
------------------------------

If you are behind a NAT and you still want to download from other
NATed / firewalled users you must forward the port in the config file
(default is 59049).
