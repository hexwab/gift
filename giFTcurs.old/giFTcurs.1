.SH NAME
giFTcurs \- cursed frontend to giFT
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B giFTcurs
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgiFTcurs\fP is a curses frontend to the giFT daemon. giFT is a hub
used to connect to many distributed filesharing networks. Right now
there is only one plugin, OpenFT. Hopefully there will be more.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (`\-\-'). A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-stickchars
Use 7-bit chars for line drawing.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of program.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Print lots of debugging information to standard error.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-server=host:port
Connect to another host than the default, localhost:1213.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-profile=name
Connect with another profile than your username. This currently has no
effect on giFT.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-nomouse
Do not read mouse clicks.
.SH USAGE
When you start giFTcurs you'll see the main screen.
The statistics in the upper right corner are the accumulated statistics
reported by giFT.
.PP
To start a search, type a query into the query field.
giFT takes each word in your query and matches it against tokenized filenames.
So a search for \fIgiFTcurs.*tar.gz\fP is parsed as \fIgiFTcurs tar gz\fP.
To exclude a word from a search, prepend the word with \fI\-\fP.
This means that a search for \fIgiFTcurs \-tar\fP, would match filenames
which contain the word \fIgiFTcurs\fP but not the word \fItar\fP.
To start a search press the Enter key or use tab to move to the
\fIStart search\fP button.
You will now hopefully see some files in the \fISearch Results\fP
box, use tab to get there.
You may later use tab to get back.
.PP
The first number in the search results list shows how many users with that
file currently have available upload slots.
This is followed by filesize and filename.
Depending on the type of the file, other meta data may be shown.
E.g., if it is an audio file, you should see bitrate and duration.
.PP
Use up/down, page up/down and home/end to navigate in the list.
To change the sorting order press left or right.
Press Enter or D when you've highlighted a file you want to download.
.PP
To monitor transfers press F3, or click on the \fITransfers\fP
button.
Use tab to change between the two lists.
The green stuff that appears on transfers is the progress bar,
not a bug.
.PP
If you're not happy with how giFTcurs looks, press F4.
You will see three lists and some buttons.
The first list contains a list of color items that can be changed by
going to the other two lists.
You can use left and right, as well as tab, to change the active field.
Press \fISave theme\fP when you're done.
The \fIShow shares\fP or \fIHide shares\fP button is used to make
giFT show your shares, or hide your shares so that new uploads can't be
started.
Please only hide your shares if you need bandwidth and please show them
again when you're done.
The \fISync shares\fP button instructs giFT to reread its configuration
and search the share root for changes.
.SH FILES
.I ~/.giFT/ui/ui.conf
.IP
This file is written by giFT\-setup and specifies the default host and
port giFT clients will connect to.
These values can be overridden by the \-s command line option.
.PP
.I ~/.giFT/ui/giFTcurs.conf
.IP
This file contains, among other things, the color theme for giFTcurs.
See
.BR giFTcurs.conf (5)
for more information.
.PP
.I ~/.giFT/ui/banwords
.IP
This file contains the words to filter, one word per line.
Regular expressions can also be used.
.SH NOTES
If your terminal leaves garbage at some places when running giFTcurs,
your TERM environment variable isn't correctly set. This could also be the
case when some keys aren't working. To fix this set the TERM environment
variable to match your terminal. Look in /usr/share/terminfo for an
entry that your terminal likes. Some examples are Eterm\-color, gnome,
mach, xterm, xterm\-xf86\-v40 and linux.
.PP
If the Fx\-keys just won't work, try M\-x or ESC\ x instead,
or simply click in the button bar.
.PP
If giFTcurs is compiled with mouse support, you can control most of it
using the mouse. If your terminal supports it, you can even use the
scroll wheel.
If you're using the mouse support and you want to cut and paste, hold
shift while doing it.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.SM DISPLAY
When set, giFTcurs will change the X title and icon of the current window.
If your terminal emulator doesn't support it, you will hear a beep instead.
.TP
.SM HOME
is used to find where the configuration file is.
.TP
.SM LOGNAME
This will be the default value to use as profile when the connection
to the daemon is made.
.TP
.SM PAGER
This program will be used to show eventual messages from the daemon
when program exits.
.TP
.SM TERM
The curses library depends on this being set to reflect your
terminal type.
.TP
.SM USER
If LOGNAME is not set, USER will be used instead.
.SH BUGS
The distributed file TODO has notes on what remains to be implemented.
.PP
If you want to report a problem with giFTcurs, please report it to our
bug tracker at SourceForge: <http://sf.net/projects/giftcurs>.
.PP
Provide a \fIdetailed\fP description of the bug, the version of the
program you were running (giFTcurs \-V displays this information), the
operating system your are running the program on and if the program
crashes, we would appreciate a stack trace.
We would also like to see the debugging output from the program, which
can be seen by passing the `\-v' flag and redirecting stderr.
