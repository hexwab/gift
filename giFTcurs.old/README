INSTALLATION

To compile giFTcurs you need to have the development headers for ncurses
and glib-2.0 installed. pkg-config is also required. When you've untarred
the sources, cd into the giFTcurs directory and type:

     ./configure
     make
     su
     make install

If things went well you should be able to run giFTcurs and connect to the
giFT daemon. If you don't have giFT, look at http://giFT.sf.net/.

Currenly giFTcurs only works with the CVS version of giFT. This is because
the interface protocol changes frequently. If things don't work then maybe
you need to get a newer version of giFTcurs, visit http://giFTcurs.sf.net/.

CONTACTING THE DEVELOPERS / GETTING SUPPORT

BUILDING FROM CVS

When reporting a bug, please try to make sure that it is present in the CVS
version of giFTcurs. Run this to get the CVS source:

     export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/giftcurs
     cvs login
     cvs -z3 co giFTcurs

Then whenever you want to update the source, just run "cvs -z3 up -Pd" in
the giFTcurs directory. To compile giFTcurs from CVS you must have the GNU
autotools (automake, autoconf), the ncurses headers, gettext and GLib 2. A
fairly recent (think 0.10.40) version of gettext is required, since we use
ngettext. With some distributions you'll need the package gettext-devel as
well. To compile type this:

     ./autogen.sh
     make
     su
     make install

A common problem is parse errors in the po/ directory, if this happens you
should try to run "cvs up -C" first. If this doesn't help, you probably
have a broken gettext installation.

PORTABILITY

giFTcurs is known to work on the following systems:

     Debian GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and cygwin.

     AIX, BeOS, Debian GNU/Hurd, Debian GNU/Linux bo hamm slink potato
     woody, FreeBSD 4.4, Mac OS X, NetBSD 1.5.2, OpenBSD 3.0, SunOS,
     Solaris, Tru64 (OSF1 V4.0), and cygwin.
