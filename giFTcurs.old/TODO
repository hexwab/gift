A realistic TODO list for giFTcurs
==================================

Stuff that's planned:
	* Ability to search on meta data.
	* Ability to choose filename for downloads.
	* Documentation. (info page, faq)
	* A screen where you browse users.
	* A screen where you see the log, maybe chat could be here as well.

Stuff that we'll probably never get to, but would be sort of nice:
	* World domination and so on.
	* Client to client chat.
	* Use readline(3) for the input fields.

Never forget, we must fight the feature creep!
