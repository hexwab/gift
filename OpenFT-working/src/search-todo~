Another OpenFT search patch. New this time round:

 * Exclusion queries (but not quoted exclusions).

 * Minor efficiency increase by sorting the entire query tokens list
   rather than just moving the shortest to the front.

 * ORDER_* constants separated out, and used in ft_search_db.c too.

 * A few comments attempting to explain what's going on.

Patches attached (note that they contain the previous patches too).

More things TODO:

 * Make ft_tokenize_* return NULL for empty queries, and fix the
   breakage that this causes.

 * Find a replacement hash algorithm for tokenization that is evenly
   distributed over the output space.

 * Work out the optimal size for a bitvector of possibly known
   tokens. I'm expecting somewhere between 2^14 and 2^20 bits (I'm
   hoping they'll be fairly sparse unless there are a lot of
   children). It could even be variable.

 * Implement calculating the aforementioned bitvector and sharing it
   with peers. A single message type, xor, should suffice for both
   insertions and removals. Use this to restrict who to send searches
   to when ttl=1.

 * Fix the ttl oddity whereby search nodes effectively gain an extra
   hop when searching. Possibly increase the peer count now that
   searches aren't being broadcast indiscriminately.

 * Restrict propagation of repeated identical searches. (The first
   step in making "search more" work usefully.)
