* Move ORDER_* into header file, use in ft_search_db.c
	
* Exclusion sets.

* Quoted searching for exclusion sets.

* Keep count of tokens, add to token record, and filter before lookup.
  Allows searching on multiple identical tokens to work as usefully as
  with phrases, and prevents '"mp3 mp3"' from being so insanely
  expensive.

* Remove null terminator from token lists, at least when stored in the
  db. (Easy ~10% space saving for individual share indices.)

* Remove search_local, move local shares into db. Simplify.

* Use callback instead of returning an Array of results.

* Replace md5 with 4-byte id in tokenidx_data and sharedata_key. Add
  md5 to sharedata_data and id to md5idx_data. (Large overall size
  efficiency increase.)

* Search by meta field. Currently only 6 (maybe 7, if path is
  separated from filename) strings are tokenized, which would be
  storable in a bitfield for one extra byte per token.
