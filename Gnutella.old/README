Compilation & Installation
--------------------------

In the main giFT directory, do:

	./autogen.sh --enable-gnutella
	make install

Then add Gnutella to the [main]/plugins line in ~/.giFT/gift.conf,
like so:

	[main]
	plugins = OpenFT:Gnutella

You may also use a fully qualified path to the plugin filename:

	[main]
	plugins = OpenFT:/usr/local/lib/giFT/libGnutella.la

Previously, you had to copy configuration files from
giFT/etc/Gnutella to $HOME/.giFT/Gnutella/, but this is no longer
true. Now, the plugin will copy these files from the
$PREFIX/share/giFT/Gnutella/ directory if necessary.
