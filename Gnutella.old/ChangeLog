Gnutella 0.0.2:
    
    * 0.0.1 would access the gwebcaches excessively due to an oversight
      that the nodes retrieved from them aren't stored because they
      have a vitality of 0. So, this increase in the release number should 
      help identifying problem behaviour between releases. 
      
      Unfortunately, this adds a new problem in that a completely stale nodes
      file will keep us from connecting. This needs a redesign to access the
      caches if we've exhausted all other options.

    * Much improved search timeout system that will detect when
      no more results for a search are likely to come back. Still need to
      check if any results are dropped, though

    * Fix leak of TCPC objects for persistent connections

    * Temporarily disabled locate requests because they need some kind
      of global queue to limit the rate at which they are produced
      
Gnutella 0.0.1:

    * Persistent HTTP support

    * Eliminated most races between download_stop and push downloads.
      There is still the possiblity of the remote end aborting the connection
      before we giFT reissues a download_start request, but that can't be
      fixed without protocol-initiated downloads.

    * Submit query-routing table of local shares to ultrapeers

    * Support for using an http proxy to access the gwebcaches (set 
      "http/proxy" key in ~/.giFT/Gnutella/Gnutella.conf)

    * Testable, but unstable Ultrapeer mode

    * Forgot to report 'Connecting' status when initiating a download

    * Added ChangeLog

    * Use a trie for storing the local shares database to improve
      lookup time. Memory usage still needs investigation

Gnutella 0.0.0:

    * Basic support for searching, downloading, and uploading
