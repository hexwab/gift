The New Way to build
--------------------

Currently, I am cross compiling giFT, so I am not sure if building it
on Windows directly works. If you want to try, you will need both
Mingw32 AND Cygwin. Make sure that you are using Mingw32's compiler,
not Cygwin's. The Cygwin environment is needed because the scripts
and the makefiles uses standard *nix commands.

To cross compile giFT on a *nix system, you will first need the
Mingw32 compiler. If you are using Debian, just 'apt-get install mingw32'.
If you are not using Debian, you can read about how to build
a cross compiler here:

http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/mingw-cross-howto.txt

I have never tried that, though.

When you have a cross compiler, do the following to build giFT:

CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc \
./autogen.sh --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc \
             --build=i386-linux --disable-gtk-client --disable-libdl \
             --enable-maintainer-mode
make

If you are not using Debian's Mingw32 package, you may have to alter
this slightly. Also, change i386-linux to whatever build host you are
using.

The Old Way to build
--------------------

This is the old way to build giFT for Win32. It may or may not
work. You might have to edit the Makefile.mingw32's.

To build the Win32 port of giFT using mingw32:

1. Install MinGW (www.mingw.org)
   Make sure mingw\bin is in PATH

2. Open a command line window

3. Make sure that you are in the giFT directory

4. Type 'make -f Makefile.mingw32'

5. Type 'make -f Makefile.mingw32 install'

6. The directory win32-dist will now contain giFT.exe and data files.
   You will have to supply configuration files in a directory named
   giFT-config
