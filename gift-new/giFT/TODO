TODO for giFT:

* update documentation
* change settings through client (with <opt/> elements?)
	* shared trees
	* download directory
	* max uploads queue
	* max downloads queue
* make <event_name id="NN"/> cancel transfers as if action="cancel" is implied
* search and respond by metadata or file characteristics other than filename
  (see hex's http://wab.chronosempire.org.uk/HEx/giFT/).
* improve mime support using mime.magic
  (see rossta's http://2ebb.com:18080/gift/gift_magic_all.tar.gz).
* fair upload queue

Win32 specific

* Modify giFTtray to notify a running giFT of configuration 
  changes via <opt />.
  <jasta> this should probably be dealt with internally by giFT...it should 
  emit an <opt conf=/> to all attached connections when it resyncs a conf
  file.
* Add code (in win32/) to run giFT as an NT/2000/XP service.

TODO for OpenFT:

* persistent http connections (very important) 
* automatic node promotion
* add a search option to filter results matching the hash of files you are
  sharing...maybe this should be a giFT-fe feature?
* meta data
* large search results should optionally compress

TODO for giFT-fe:

* preferences
* find a new permanent maintainer
