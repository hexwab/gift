.TH giFT 1 "21 June 2002" "giFT version 0.10.0" 
.SH NAME
giFT \- the giFT daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR giFT " [ " options "... ]"
.RI "[ " protocol-libs "... ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B giFT 
is like a `bridge'. It can handle multiple file sharing protocols. The
protocols will be dynamically loaded as `plugins'. That's one side of
the bridge.
.P
The other side of the bridge is a bastardized XML-like protocol, which provides
the frontend a unified method to work with all file sharing protocols.
