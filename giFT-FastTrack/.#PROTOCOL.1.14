                       The FastTrack Protocol
                       ======================

FastTrack protocol.

All integers are in network byte order (big-endian) unless noted
otherwise. "Packed integers" are BER compressed, as produced by
pack("w") in perl. From TFM: "its bytes represent an unsigned integer
in base 128, most significant digit first, with as few digits as
possible. Bit eight (the high bit) is set on each byte except the
last."

Network overview
================

FastTrack nodes are either normal "user" nodes, or "supernodes".

Supernodes are responsible for indexing users' shares and for
performing search queries on them; possibly for other tasks such as
statistics too.

User nodes do not communicate with each other. Instead, user nodes
connect to a supernode, and supernodes forward traffic between
themselves as required.

The user node:supernode ratio is about 100:1. (FIXME: verify this.)

User nodes can be "promoted" to supernode status if network conditions
require this. Promotion is autonomous (i.e. a supernode will believe
you if you tell it you're also a supernode).  The conditions for
promotion are unknown, although it's reasonable to assume one or more
of high bandwidth, low latency, and plenty of CPU/RAM are sought
after.

Little is currently known about supernode-supernode communication,
thus we will be concerned only with user nodes connecting to a
supernode. (However, KaZaA has a configuration option to force
supernode status which appears very useful for analysis; expect more
information on supernodes in the near future.)

The default KaZaA port is 1214, although recent versions (>=2.0
apparently) use a random port; some also listen on port 80.

Transfers take place over the KaZaA port too, but use HTTP. Thus,
it's necessary to check whether an incoming connection looks like an
HTTP request before attempting a session handshake. (Having said that,
user nodes do not usually receive anything other than HTTP
connections.)

Kazaa also listens for UDP packets on the same port as it uses for TCP.

Session establishment
=====================

-> is client-to-server traffic, <- is server-to-client traffic.
= is traffic sent between supernodes.

1. Initial handshake [->]

  Bytes	Desc
  4     unknown ("rand")
  4     outgoing cipher seed
  4     requested encryption type (encoded)

  "rand" is not entirely random. Kazaa clients seem to use random-like
  numbers here, and their traffic is still decryptable. giFT-FastTrack
  uses a constant (0xFA00B62B), and experiments have shown that changing
  this will produce connection failures. (TODO: can giFT-FastTrack
  connect using Kazaa's numbers?)

  Cipher seed can be any number.

  It's suggested to set requested encryption type to zero.

2. Handshake response [<-]

  Bytes Desc
  4     incoming cipher seed
  4     encryption type (encoded)

  I *think* cipher seed can again be any number.

  Outgoing cipher seed is xor'd with the incoming cipher seed to produce
  the final outgoing seed for encryption initialization.

  The returned encryption type is authoritative for both incoming and
  outgoing cipher streams; Kazaa sends ((requested_enc_type &
  supported_enc_type) | minimum_enc_type). Current values for
  supported_enc_type and minimum_enc_type are 0xBF and 0x29
  respectively. See also network config.


All communication from this point forth is encrypted.

3. Server network name [<-]

  Bytes	Desc
  n     zero-terminated network name

  Observed network names are "KaZaA", "fileshare" (as used by iMesh),
  "Grokster", "MusicCity" (defunct?)...

4. Client network name [->]

  Bytes Desc
  n     zero-terminated network name

  Kazaa tends to drop the connection if the two network names do not
  match. I'm not entirely sure why. giFT-FastTrack (which sends
  "KaZaA" as its network name) appears to do the same.


At this point, the session is established. Either side can send traffic.

Communication consists of one of the following:

5. Ping request [->, <-]

  Bytes Desc
  1     0x50

  This is for testing the aliveness of the connection, as used by
  every P2P network on the planet. Elicits a Pong response. Unknown:
  Kazaa always sends a pong for each ping received; but is it possible
  to send *any* traffic to keep the connection alive?

6. Pong response [->, <-]

  Bytes Desc
  1     0x52

  See ping above.

7. Packet [->, <-]

  Bytes Desc
  1     0x4B
  4     encoded message type and length

  Message type is two bytes (of which one is used for flags); length
  is a two-byte integer. Those four bytes are stored in one of
  three orders, according to a variable that historically has been
  called "xinu_state".

  xinu_state is a 32-bit unsigned integer. For each side of the
  connection, it is initialized as 0x51. The order is determined by
  xinu_state mod 3:

           xinu_state % 3
  Bytes   0       1       2
  1      type_lo type_hi type_hi
  1      type_hi len_hi  len_lo
  1      len_hi  type_lo len_hi
  1      len_lo  len_lo  type_lo

  Where "len_hi" and "len_lo" are the high and low bytes of the
  message length respectively, and similarly for "type_hi" and
  "type_lo".

  After each packet, xinu_state is xor'd with the sum of the message
  type (both bytes of it) and message length, then all bits are
  inverted. (FIXME: there must be a better way to calculate this...)



Message types
=============

0x00 Supernode list [<-]

  Bytes Desc
  4	IPv4 address
  2	port
  1	"last seen"
  1	"load"

  "Last seen" and "load" are from giFT-FastTrack. Last seen is in
  minutes, load is a percentage. Allegedly.

  This 8 bytes structure can be repeated several times within a single
  message. Kazaa appears always to send 200 nodes (i.e. a 1600 byte
  message) when a connection has just been established, but it's
  probably unwise to rely on this.

0x01 Extended supernode information(?) [=]

  Repeate as many times as necessary:

  Bytes Desc
  4     IPv4 address
  2     port
  20    unknown

  This is used to tell the remote node that we are a supernode, and
  henceforth for other supernode-related stuff.

0x02 User information [->]

  Bytes Desc
  4     IPv4 address
  2     port
  1     bandwidth
  1     unknown (zero?)
  n     user name (no terminator)

  From giFT: "This next byte [bandwidth] represents the
  user's advertised bandwidth, on a logarithmic scale.  0xd1
  represents "infinity" (actually, 1680 kbps). The value is
  approximately 14*log_2(x)+59, where x is the bandwidth in kbps."

0x03 ??? [<-]

  Always has a length of 0?

0x04 Share file [->]

  Defunct?

0x05 Unshare file [->]

  Bytes Desc
  20    file hash
  n     file id (packed integer)
  n     file size (packed integer)
  n     number of tags (packed integer)

  Then for each tag:

  Bytes Desc
  n     tag type (packed integer)
  n     tag length (packed integer)
  n     tag contents

0x06 Search query [->]

  Bytes Desc
  2     unknown (0x00 0x01)
  2     maximum number of search results (0x32 in kazaa, 0x10 for hash queries)
  2     search id
  1     unknown (0x01)
  1     search realm
  1     number of search terms

  Search id is a unique identifier to refer to this search. Realm may
  be one of:
    0xA1  Audio
    0xA2  Video
    0xA3  Images
    0xA4  Documents
    0xA5  Software
    0xBF  Everything

  Then, for each search term:

  Bytes Desc
  1     comparison type
  n     comparison field tag type (packed integer?)
  n     query length (packed integer)
  n     query (non-terminated)

  Comparison type is one of:
    0x00  equals
    0x02  at most
    0x03  "approx"
    0x04  at least
    0x05  substring
    0x06  unknown

0x07 Search reply [<-]

  Bytes Desc
  4     supernode IPv4 address
  2     supernode port
  2     search id
  2     number of results

  Contains search results from a single supernode.

  For each result:

  Bytes Desc
  4     IPv4 address
  2     port
  1     bandwidth
  n     user and network name
  20    file hash
  n     file id (packed integer)
  n     file size (packed integer)
  n     number of tags

  User and network name are separated by 0x01 and terminated by
  0x00. A special value of 0x02 somehow refers to earlier replies
  (just uses the user from the previous result? compares the IP with
  previous ones? FIXME!).
  The file id is used when downloading the file with the old, gnutella like,
  format. Kazaa uses a checksum of the hash for this but we think it's just an
  arbitrary id at the protocol level.

  Then for each tag:

  Bytes Desc
  n     tag type (packed integer)
  n     tag length (packed integer)
  n     tag contents

0x08 Search finished [<-]

  Bytes Desc
  2     search id

0x09 Network stats [<-]

  Bytes Desc
  4     Number of users
  4     Number of files
  2     Mantissa of total file size
  2     Exponent of total file size

  Then repeated 6 times, once for each media type (misc, audio, video,
  images, documents, software) (FIXME: check ordering):

  Bytes Desc
  4     Number of files
  2     Mantissa of total file size
  2     Exponent of total file size

  Then *optionally* (earlier versions of Kazaa were limited
  to the 60 bytes shown above), repeated once for each network:

  Bytes Desc
  n     zero-terminated network name
  4     Number of users

0x0A Search forward request? [=]

  Bytes Desc
  4     IPv4 address
  2     port
  4     IPv4 address
  2     port
  1     unknown (0x02)
  4     unknown (some kind of ID?)
  1     unknown (0x00)
  1     unknown
  1     unknown (0x01?)
  1     search realm
  1     number of search terms

  Then follows a query in the usual format. See search query.

0x800A Search forward request 2? [=]

  Bytes Desc
  4     unknown
  1     unknown (0x00)
  1     unknown
  1     unknown (0x01?)
  1     search realm
  1     number of search terms

  Then follows a query in the usual format. See search query.

  (Seemingly this is the same as the previous message except without
  the addresses and ports.)

0x0C ??? [=]

0x0D Push request [->, <-]

  User->supernode version:

  Bytes Desc
  4     push ID
  4     local IPv4 address
  2     local port
  4     private IPv4 address of remote user
  2     remote user's port (unused?)
  4     IPv4 address of remote user's supernode?
  2     port of remote user's supernode?
  n     remote user name (not terminated)

  Requests that the given user connects to us.

  Supernode->user version:

  Bytes Desc
  4     push ID
  4     requester's IPv4 address
  2     requester's port

  Requests that we connect to the given user.

0x15 Attempt UDP connection [->, <-]

  Bytes Desc
  4     IPv4 address
  2     port

  For supernodes(?):

  Bytes Desc
  4     unknown

  This should elicit a UDP packet of type 0xC0 from the recipient to
  the specified address, which is usually (always?) the address of the
  sender.

0x16 ??? [->, <-]

  Bytes Desc
  4     unknown (0xC7 0xDA 0x08 0xC9)
  4     unknown (0x0F 0x7B 0x6B 0x75)
  3     unknown (0x58 0xC3)

  The packet from supernode to client is always empty?

0x17 ??? [<-]

  Zero length.

0x1D Network name [->, <-]

  Bytes Desc
  n     Network name, no terminator

  Why this message exists is unclear, given that network names are
  exchanged are part of handshaking.

0x1E ??? [->, <-]

  Bytes Desc
  2     unknown (0x00 0x00)
  2     unknown (0x00 0x7B from kazaa, 0x00 0x00 from imesh)

  This is sent after connecting by the supernode and the client replies
  with the same type.

UDP messages
============

The first byte is the message type:

0x27 Node ping [->]

  Bytes Desc
  1     0x27
  4     minimum encryption type
  1     unknown (0x80)
  n     zero-terminated network name

  Kazaa "pings" supernodes before attempting a TCP connection.

0x28 Node pong [<-]

  Bytes Desc
  1     0x28
  4     minimum encryption type
  1     unknown (0x00)
  1     unknown (Incremented by 1 approx every 30 minutes, stays within +/-1 at
                 any given time for a sample of 200 nodes.)
  2     unknown (In a 200 node sample 81 were 0x3c13, 40 were 0x5d06,
                 11 were 0x800e, 10 were 0xc005.)
  1     load (load in percent, Same value as in TCP message 0x00)
  1     number of children? (Majority evenly destributed below 15. About 15
                             percent above 220. Large gap in between. Changes
                             too fast to be uptime in minutes.)
  n     zero-terminated network name

  Kazaa only seems to connect to nodes that return 0x28 in response to a ping,
  never nodes that return 0x29.

0x29 Node pong 2 (?) [<-]

  Bytes Desc
  1     0x29
  4     minimum encryption type
  1     unknown (0x01 or 0x02)
  1     flag (0x00 or 0x01)
  2     unknown (0x00 0x00)
  4     unknown ID

  If "flag" is 1:

  Bytes Desc
  4     sender's IPv4 address
  2     port
  2     unknown

  Flag means "available for incoming connections"?

0x2A ??? [->]

  Bytes Desc
  1     0x2A
  4     ID

  Seems to be sent in response to a 0x29 (but only if flag was set?).
  Often (but not always) results in a 0xC0.

0xC0 ??? [->,<-?]

  Bytes Desc
  1     0xC0
  1     unknown (0x28?)
  n     unknown

0xC1 ???

  Bytes Desc
  1     0xC1
  1     unknown
  1     unknown
  4     IPv4 address of destination(?!)

0xC2 ???

0xC3 ???

Transfers
=========

Transfers use non-persistent HTTP/1.1. There are two forms of
requests: hash-based:

"GET /.hash=8e0cda92da564448da5ec5070f3231907abac2a6 HTTP/1.1"

where the hexadecimal number is the 20-byte hash; and the older
filename-based:

"GET /13609/filename.ext HTTP/1.1"

where the decimal number is the file id. Note that, unlike
Gnutella, the requested filename must match the shared filename.

Kazaa can also serve an HTML page containing a list of shared files;
this used to be globally available but is now restricted to loopback
connections (i.e. 127.0.0.1 only; even other local interfaces won't
work).

Other possible Kazaa path formats include "/.download/%u.%s",
"/.supernode%s", "/.status%s", "/.network%s", "/.files". See below for
information on "/.files"; not sure what the rest do, or even if they
still work. Some (all?) of them seem to require some kind of
authentication.

Standard HTTP headers used:
  
  Host [->]
  Range [->]
  Connection [->]

  Content-Type [<-]
  Last-Modified [<-]
  Server [<-]
  Date [<-]
  Content-Length [<-]
  Accept-Ranges [<-]

See RFC 2616.

Nonstandard HTTP headers used:

  X-Kazaa-Username [->, <-]
       user name

  X-Kazaa-Network [->, <-]
       network name

  X-Kazaa-IP [->, <-]

  X-Kazaa-SupernodeIP [->, <-]

  UserAgent (note misspelling) [->]

  X-Kazaa-XferId [->]
      ???

  X-Kazaa-XferUid [->]
      Apparently something to do with participation level. FIXME.

  X-KazaaTag [<-]
      in the format "%d=%s"
      integers are converted to decimal first. Hashes (tag type 3) are
      sent in base64, with a preceding '='. Filename (tag type 2) is
      omitted, even for hash-based requests.

For push transfers, the remote user connects and sends 
"GIVE 4253679545\r\n", where the integer is the 4-byte push ID.
There then follows a normal HTTP connection with roles reversed.


Listing shared files
====================

Sending an HTTP GET request with a path of "/.files" results in the
following pseudo-HTTP response (connection is left open):

"HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden 38 2273515777\r\n\r\n"

Where 38 is the encryption type (decimal), and 2273515777 is the
4-byte challenge (again decimal).

The 4-byte challenge response (details as yet unknown; FIXME) is sent
as raw binary, followed by two binary zeros. The server then sends a
full HTTP response (including headers), and a body in the usual shares
format:

Repeated for each file:

  Bytes Desc
  20    file hash
  n     checksum (packed integer)
  n     file size (packed integer)
  n     number of tags

  Then for each tag:

  Bytes Desc
  n     tag type (packed integer)
  n     tag length (packed integer)
  n     tag contents


Tag types
=========

Most of these need verifying.

                   shares to the supernode. It is thus assumed that the
                   supernode only uses the first 20 bytes (which are the same
                   as 'hash') for the actual searching. Lame.
>>>>>>> 1.13

All integers are packed. Strings are not terminated. Type "intint" is
two consecutive packed integers.

hash is the old 16 byte md5 + 4 byte smallhash.
kzhash is the old 20 byte hash + 16 byte md5 tree.

The "any" tag is not a real tag, and is used for searching only.


Hash format
===========

Hashes are 20 bytes long, and consist of a 16-byte MD5 and a 4-byte
CRC. The MD5 is of the first 300K (i.e. 307200 bytes) of the file.
The CRC is reflected, has a generator polynomial of 0x04C11DB7 and an
initial value of 0xFFFFFFFF.

The CRC is generated sparsely; not all the file is read. It starts at
an offset of 1MB (i.e. 1048576 bytes), a complete 300K chunk is hashed
(partial chunks are ignored), the offset is doubled and the process is
repeated until there are no chunks left. Then the final 300K of
the file is hashed, except where this would overlap with a previous
chunk, in which case only the not-previously-hashed part is hashed.

Finally, the CRC is xor'd with the lower 32 bits of the file size.
And, unusually, it is stored little-endian.

(FIXME: verify all this.)
  
There is also a 2-byte "checksum", which is simply a CRC of the full
20-byte hash. Non-reflected, polynomial 0x1021, initial value zero.
The top two bits are masked off (i.e. and with 0x3FFF), which I can
only presume is so that a packed checksum is guaranteed to fit into
two bytes...


A few words about encryption
============================

This is *not* a detailed description of the encryption algorithms,
merely a high-level overview.

Each side of the connection has a 63-byte pad, which is initialized
based upon a seed that is sent in the clear. Encryption type is a
bitfield; each bit represents an algorithm that may or not be applied
to mangle the initial pad.

Once the pad has been initialized, a stream of pseudo-random bytes is
produced. These are xor'd with each byte sent to produce the encrypted
stream.

The actual details of the pad initialization, and even the stream
cipher, are unimportant: providing both sides of the connection
generate the same stream, they can talk to each other. Hence most of
the pad mangling algorithms appear to have no pattern, and I think
it's probable that they've been created randomly.

Note that the fact that all the information required for
initialization is sent in the clear (rather than using a public-key
algorithm) means that decryption of sniffed sessions is easy.

There are many details omitted here that are, frankly, uninteresting,
and easier to describe in code in any case.

* A lot of the information here is second- or third-hand. I've
  attempted to verify what I can, but it's not always been
  possible. Much is still unknown.

* This document should probably have been started a couple of years
  ago...
