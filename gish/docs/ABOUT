:: Gift ::

The meat of all of these projects is a dainty little Perl module by the 
name of Gift. It handles all of the silly low level stuff you'd normally 
have to deal with when making an interface to giFT. Yes, I realize the 
casing is incompatible with the name of the software it is meant to use 
- you can thank Jasta for that ;)


:: gish ::

A streamlined, sexy command line interface to the giFT daemon, of course 
making use of Gift.pm - this magnificent piece of work is the brainchild 
of a confused and bewildered Jasta. It has gone through many 
incantations before reaching it's current fully evolved state. More 
information about where the project is headed, and a few ideas 
currently on the drawing board can be found in gish-examples.txt


:: gish-uri ::

A URI parsing utility built around the gish command line interface. 
Written by jasta with code stolen from weinholt's uri2gift.


:: examples/usegift.pl ::

A small, simple, well documented example of how to use the Gift library 
for several giFT operations. Not all functions are used in this program, 
nor is it really guaranteed to work. It is meant to be a proof of 
concept of how the Gift module can accomplish things with minimal 
effort.


:: examples/uri2gift ::

A simple URI parsing program originally written by weinholt. I rebuilt 
it to use Gift.pm and as a result, the code is much more lean, and in 
general more functional. Should work at the least with sig2dat and 
magnet URIs.


:: examples/giftexile :::

The gimp legged, foaming at the mouth bastard step-brother of gish - 
if you find any valid use for this program, please do tell! Eventually 
hopefully will be a light weight, gnut style interface to giFT.
