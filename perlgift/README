Design goals:

* Small amount of desktop real estate required
* Lots of features
* Emphasis on utility rather than user-friendliness
* Separate windows for each activity
* Absolutely no fucking tabs! 
	I don't like tabs. You probably already guessed that.

FUQ ("unasked")

Q: Why no realm search?
A: Realm searches are evil.


TODO:
* Exclusive downloads (only one; any one)
* Quick download by hash
* Search within results
* Weed out obviously-bad results (1 disagrees on hash when n agree)
* Sort parents of tuplets by most popular filename
* Drag'n'drop files: drag from shares/uploads to get filename; drag from downloads to get partial filename/completed filename
* Files listed by hits in shares window; also failed hits (need gift.pl cooperation)
* Upload manager: set rates by filename/type/size/dir (need gift.pl cooperation)
* Group uploads by user/filename
* Karma (-- for downloading stuff, ++ for uploading, ++ for resharing downloads)
* Whole album downloading (check tracknumber tag or /\D?(\d\d)\D/)
* Freedb album verification
* Auto-renaming by tag
* Socket connection for command submission
* Search ShareReactor clone
* Collections (file containing several filenames and hashes)

* Total filesize of selected items
