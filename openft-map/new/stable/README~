A lot of people seem to arrive here in search of an up-to-date nodes
file for OpenFT.  That isn't originally what I put this directory up
for (it contains mainly scripts for autogenerating the distributed
nodes file from spider output), but seeing as how you're here, I have
a few suggestions:

1. Make sure you're running the latest OpenFT release (0.2.1.4 at the
time of writing). Check giftd --version to be sure.

2. Try stopping giftd, removing ~/.giFT/OpenFT/nodes, and
restarting. Also make sure that location is writable by giftd.

3. Give it 20 minutes to connect.

If all that fails, you could try "nodes.current" in this directory,
which is a symlink to the nodes file of my running node.  But you
should make absolutely sure it doesn't work after the suggestions
above, first, and you should also inform people on #gift (we'd like to
know if the distributed nodes file really is completely stale, so it
can be fixed).

HEx.
