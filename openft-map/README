Set of scripts capable of producing visualizations of the OpenFT network.
Please note that daily spider.pl maps are produced at
http://jasta.gotlinux.org/openft/.  The daily generated png images are
available at http://fnord.csbnet.se/openft/.  Please use these instead of
creating your own.

Intended usage:

 # ./spider.pl < nodes_list > map

Will start from the search node(s) described in the file `nodes_list' and dump
data to file `map'.  The format of the nodes_list is as follows:

{host}         {port} {http_port} {class} {version}
68.116.100.143 1215   1216        7       0x00020101

 # ./draw.py < map

Try "./draw.py --help" for options

draw.py Requires the Python Imaging Library: "python-imaging" on Debian.

World map notes:

 - Requires xplanet.
 - The map is saved as a JPEG (PNG resulted in 1.1MB file), so the text will
   get blurred and lines may look weird.  So, avoid resolving names for search
   nodes, ie. use the -n switch.
 - Make sure you have the geo-cache file in place, so you don't hammer
   netgeo.caida.org asking for locations the way I did.  Note that this cache
   is map {ip:(lat,long)} saved using Python's pickle module, so don't try
   to edit it.
