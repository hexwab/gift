giftd 0.11.9:

   * Gracefully handle corrupt shares file without asserting.

   * Made keeping corrupted files a config option.

   * Ignore duplicate and inclusive share roots. Specifically avoid sharing
     download folder twice if user adds it to share root as well.

   * It is now possible for front ends to search on an arbitrary subset of
     networks by passing multiple network names separated by spaces in the
     proto() field.

giftd 0.11.8:

   * Shares are now keyed by pathname instead of by hash. (Hashes
     weren't guaranteed to exist, could collide for identical files,
     and no lookup function was provided in any case).

   * Handle syncing properly.  Share objects are no longer freed
     without letting plugins know, and plugin-specific data is no
     longer leaked.

   * ImageMagick support removed and replaced by Jef Pokanzer's
     image_size.  This fixes a multitude of problems related to
     dependencies, performance, stability and security.

   * The --index-only option no longer tries to bind to the interface
     port.

   * Avoid aborting on transfers >=2Gb.  Such transfers still don't
     work, though, but this is a stdio limitation and cannot be portably
     solved.

giftd 0.11.7:

   * Filter LOCATE requests so that they are not delivered to protocol plugins
     which do not have a registered hash handler for the hash type being
     searched for.

   * Preserve extension when renaming downloaded files because the file name
     is already used.

   * Removed requirement for state files having leading dot on Windows.

   * Fixed bug which prevented completed dir from being shared if no sharing
     root was set.

   * Added meta data extraction for bittorrent files.

   * Added check to not share incoming dir if not specifically allowed by
     config. 

   * Fixed some bugs which could lead to shares db corruption.

   * Added saving of download paused state across restarts.

giftd 0.11.6:

   * Fixed a major bug that caused assertion failures in OpenFT because
     wrapper_source_abort was discarding source information on active chunks.

   * Fixed a problem with the download queue where after six hours the
     re-request interval becomes less than is needed to stay on the _upload_
     queue.

   * Fixed some minor memory leaks related to the interface protocol.

   * Added a timer to abort stale uploads that don't make progress for a
     while.

   * Updated documentation.

   * Made some attempt at handling the situation when downloads encounter
     write-errors instead of aborting.

giftd 0.11.5:

   * Case-insensitive scheme names in protocol-specific URLs in an
     ongoing effort to comply with RFC1738.

   * Fixed a minor memory leak when searching on non-ATTACH'd sessions.

   * Fixed a potential race condition where the forked share_cache.c child
     might use the memory local to gift_conf_path.  Perhaps other
     thread-safety issues exist?

   * Minor cleanups in download.c to fix an obscure throttling bug.
   
   * Decreased the minimum chunk size to 100KB to obscure the lack of proper
     source election for the last part of a transfer.
     
   * Fixed a problem writing state files for downloads which have no plugin
     hash associated.  This is extremely common on some networks such as
     Gnutella and OpenNap.

   * If we have a problem writing the state file or temporary data
     for a transfer, abort the entire giftd process rather than pretend to
     gracefully handle the condition.  This condition always results in
     a corrupted transfer if it is unpaused as there is no rollback method
     implemented.

   * Fixed a bug that would prevent loading plugins from the command-line in
     the current directory without prefixing the plugin name with "./".

   * Major win32 portability improvements.

giftd 0.11.4:

   * Made the upload queue support small chunks better.  The upload slot is
     now retained across requests until a size allocation is exceeded.

giftd 0.11.3:

   * Added new command line switches to override the compile time directory
     paths.  This is useful for projects which are attempting to package
     giFT in a self-contained distribution.  See giftd -h.

   * Various build environment improvements.

giftd 0.11.2:

   * Separated OpenFT and Gnutella into their own modules, and in the process
     inadvertantly broke the optional libltdl support (it will not work
     without).  Hopefully this will be corrected in future releases.

   * Renamed several components to their lowercase alternatives.  Also changed
     the giFT binary to giftd and updated the name of gift.log and gift.conf
     to reflect this change.

giftd 0.11.1:

   * First public release.  Enjoy :)

giftd 0.10.0:

   * Rewritten from the ground up.  See the ChangeLog in the parent
     directory for more information on what giFT once was.
