Documentation:

  * Update documentation...we needs lots of help here.

Design:

  * Add an HTTP/HTML default web interface built into the daemon that can
    be used to supplement the features not provided by the interface protocol.
  * Allow for greater control of giFT behaviour from plugins, including
    the ability to control multi-source transfer chunk boundaries.
  * Improve the interface protocol and internals related to uploads and their
    usage of the Source object.  This conceptual link should not be made and
    it is actually causing problems with the plugin interface for uploads.
  * Greatly improved security mechanism for interface protocol connections,
    including an option to use a local named socket.
  * Add automatic source searching to the daemon (possibly provide hooks for
    plugins to use to extend the behaviour more intelligently).

Code:

  * Switch to the newly introduced BOOL libgift type.
  * Doxygen the entire project.
  * Transfer system rewrite (pending in jasta's local source tree, but not
    yet completed).

    UNIX:

      * Test for fork's presence and implement a blocking platform_child_proc
        if it's nowhere to be found.

    Windows:

      * Add code (in win32/) to run giFT as an NT/2000/XP service.

  * Break away Gnutella and OpenFT into their own separate CVS modules and
    partially decouple the release schedule.


...and lots more...
