This project is very much so open to outside developer contribution, however I
would like to request that anyone making changes abide by the formatting the
rest of the project follows.  It is very important that the project maintains
a consistent design and style through whitespace usage, syntax, and
conventions.  Please double check any changes before submitting them for patch
approval.
