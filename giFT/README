If you are a new user to the project, please refer to the QUICKSTART guide. If
you are having troubles and would like support please see
http://www.giftproject.org/contact.php for information on where to send
requests.  Please keep the non-developer traffic in our IRC channel to an
absolute minimum.

Please note that our documentation is quite the mess, and in fact most of it
does not apply any longer.  If you are interested in improving it, please
contact the project administrators and we will gladly get you started.

===============================================================================

Do not confuse this project with GIFT (GNU Image Finding Tool), which is
available at http://www.gnu.org/software/gift/.  Both projects were created
around a similar time (early 2001, I believe) and unfortunately realized the
collision well after both projects had settled in.

Also note that the name OpenFT inadvertently conflicts with a product from
Fujitsu-Siemens named openFT.  Interestingly enough though their product
doesn't appear to be open at all; it is a wonder why they chose that name.
