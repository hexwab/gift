      <ul>
        <li><b><em>What is giFT?</em></b><br />
        giFT is a plugin system that can be used to connect to many different networks. But for now
        OpenFT is the only network you can use. If you want to write a plugin for other networks
        (Gnutella, OpenNAP), please contact us.</li>

        <li><b><em>Where is your IRC channel?</em></b><br />
        irc.openprojects.net, join channel #giFT.</li>

        <li><b><em>And, is it usable already?</em></b><br />
        Yes it is, very usable, but also very unstable. If you want to help us finding bugs, and
        you promise to update your copy daily, you can use it.</li>

        <li><b><em>Well then, how do I install and use giFT?</em></b><br />
        That question is pretty much what the <a href= 
        "http://gift.sourceforge.net/docs/?document=install.html">Installation Guide</a> is all
        about... go read it.</li>

        <li><b><em>Why are you against the distributing of binaries?</em></b><br />
        giFT is not ready. And if you&#39;re unable to build it yourself, it&#39;s not for you. We
        don&#39;t want lots different and incompatible version floating around, because they
        pollute our current test network.</li>

        <li><b><em>So, when do you release?</em></b><br />
        When it&#39;s done. Once all feature users will want are implemented and all bugs are
        squashed, and all documentation is up to date... then we&#39;ll probably release. This
        could take a few weeks, it could take it few months. Just keep checking :-).</li>

        <li><b><em>Why do you use a daemon?</em></b><br />
        It creates an easy way for people to focus their time on frontends instead of all of so
        much networking code. Also, if the daemon changes, all of the frontends will still function
        the same as they had before. This also makes it so we don&#39;t end up with 20 incompatible
        protocols flying around as standalone clients.</li>

        <li><b><em>How did this all began?</em></b><br />
        Development to create a Linux client to KaZaA was our initial goal. After a lot of reverse
        engineering and packet sniffing, a group of talented developers which became known as
        &quot;the givers&quot; stumbled onto our project (at the time &quot;kazaatux&quot;). Within
        a few weeks, we had a working daemon that could connect to and search the KaZaA network.
        Shortly after, KaZaA released a new version of their client which eventually led to the
        breaking of what we now call giFT. After the permanent departure of the givers, the giFT
        team started moving development into a new direction; foremost was the desire to have a
        completely open, completely free peer to peer network modeled in the image of FastTrack.
        Thus OpenFT was born. giFT was moved to a new plugin architecture which would allow the
        creation of plugins that would make it easy for one client to be compatible with any number
        of networks. The first of these plugins were to be OpenFT.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><b><em>How can I help speed up development?</em></b><br />
        Use your special skills! If you can code, design a nifty GUI or are specialized in Public
        Relations, or whatever, drop into our IRC channel and ask what <em>you</em> can do.</li>

        <li><b><em>I&#39;ve got an idea! What if...</em></b><br />
        You&#39;re not the first one. If you want to discuss your idea or the way giFT currently
        works, please <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gift-openft">subscribe
        to gift-openft@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</li>

        <li><b><em>Will giFT be ported to any other hosts?</em></b><br />
        The program was initially designed for Linux, but the recent version compiles on *BSD,
        Solaris, OS X, and Windows (natively!) too. You&#39;re always welcome to port giFT to your
        platform of choice. Please contact us if you&#39;re successful.</li>

        <li><b><em>Front-end Developers</em></b><br />
        See the <a href="http://gift.sourceforge.net/docs/?document=interface.html">Interface
        Protocol Documentation</a>. We especially need a Windows GUI.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><b><em>What&#39;s this OpenFT I&#39;ve been hearing about?</em></b><br />
        It&#39;s an Open Source &quot;clone&quot; of FastTrack currenty being worked on by the giFT
        project. We welcome anyone with decentralized/p2p experience to drop by and poke around at
        our design.</li>

        <li><b><em>Can I use OpenFT without giFT?</em></b><br />
        Yes, if you write a framework for it, like giFT. So, the real answer is: no.</li>

        <li><b><em>Is there documentation available on how OpenFT works?</em></b><br />
        No, but the source code is pretty readable :-). The main problem is to find someone
        motivated enough to write this document, if you want to do it, contact us through IRC or
        use <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gift-openft">the mailing
        list</a>.</li>

        <li><b><em>What is this &quot;FastTrack&quot;?</em></b><br />
        FastTrack is the company that licenses the library that KaZaA/Morpheus/Grokster operates
        off of.</li>

        <li><b><em>What&#39;s your connection with FastTrack?</em></b><br />
        giFT 0.9 used the FastTrack network. FastTrack changed the encryption, end of story. For
        the last 6 months we&#39;ve been fully focused on the &quot;new&quot; giFT and</li>

        <li><b><em>Are you working on getting back into FastTrack&#39;s network?</em></b><br />
        No. Although quite a few people made attempts to reverse engineer the new encryption,
        nobody has succeeded, and nobody is working on it anymore because OpenFT kicks so much ass
        nobody even remembers FastTrack.</li>
