TODO for giFT:

* update documentation
* change settings through client (with <opt/> elements?)
	* shared trees
	* download directory
	* max uploads queue
	* max downloads queue
* make <event_name id="NN"/> cancel transfers as if action="cancel" is implied
* search and respond by metadata or file characteristics other than filename
  (see hex's http://wab.chronosempire.org.uk/HEx/giFT/).
* improve mime support using mime.magic
  (see rossta's http://2ebb.com:18080/gift/gift_magic_all.tar.gz).

Win32 specific

* Convert gift.exe to a native win32 app. I would suggest we add a 
  win32/winmain.c containing a WinMain function which calls the src/main.c's
  main() function.
* Add code to enable gift to be a tray icon. Right clicking the tray icon would
  yield the following menu:
  Enable      Enable shares
  Disable     Disable shares
  Setup...    Display setup dialog box
  View Log... View debug log
  About...    Display Copyright & GPL license
  Exit        Shutdown gift
* Add error.c to move error reporting functions (GIFT_ERROR(), etc.) to
  common place, so we can redirect program output to our choosing. (rossta)
* Check in mjvh's giftsetup to gift's cvs repository (jasta said to wait)
  <jasta> I want that stuff added only after giFT's internals are fully 
  capable of reading the registry keys it provides.
* Modify giftsetup to use "wizard" interface (back/next/finish).
* Modify giftsetup to read existing configuration files and update if 
  necessary.  Currently it only supports writing initial files.
* Modify giftsetup to notify a running giFT of configuration changes via <opt>.
  <jasta> this should probably be dealt with internally by giFT...it should 
  emit an <opt conf=/> to all attached connections when it resynches a conf
  file
* Add code (in win32/) to run giFT as a NT/2000/XP service.

TODO for OpenFT:

* improvements to the HTTP support (become HTTP/1.1 compliant)
* automatic node promotion
* add a search option to filter results matching the hash of files you are
  sharing...maybe this should be a giFT-fe feature?

TODO for giFT-fe:

* preferences
