This is a FastTrack plugin for giFT (www.giftproject.org)
...just in case you haven't guessed.

Obviosuly I take no responsibility as to what this code does to
your hardware, data, physical or mental health.

Then again, running KaZaA in wine may destroy all of the above.


Compilation & Installation
--------------------------

Please note that the plugin currently only works on little-endian
machines. This means MAC users are out of luck, sorry.

Currently there is only a simple make file.
(You're welcome to provide something better)

So just copy everything into giFT/FastTrack (the giFT source dir
you got from cvs) and run "make" and "make install" there.

Maybe look at the Makefile first since it makes some
stupid assumptions about your system.

To test it run "giFT -p /usr/local/lib/giFT/FastTrack.so"
Or you can add the path to your gift.conf like so:

plugin = OpenFT:/usr/local/lib/giFT/FastTrack.so

Most of the plugin code was taken from OpenFT and old giFT code and
as such is copyrighted by the gift project.

Thanks to weinholt for reverse engineering most parts of enc_type_1.c

enc_type_2.c is the work of Raimar Falke, I merely cleaned it up a bit.
