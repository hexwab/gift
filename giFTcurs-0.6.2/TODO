STUFF LIKELY TO BE DONE
-----------------------

      A debugging key. You press it and it dumps info about the marked
       item in the console.

      Hilight new transfers.

      Ability to tag search results and perform an action on all tagged
       ones.

      Ability to search on meta data.

      Ability to choose filename for downloads.

      More documentation (e.g., a FAQ, something documenting hidden
       features.)

      A screen where you browse users.

      Numbered links, as in lynx. Like say you move on page down with
       space and then you see foobar.ogg as entry 39 and you press 3 and 9
       and then enter. Request from b0ef.

      Move away from glib's logging facility, since it has a silly buffer
       that is 1025 bytes in size. We need more. (Maybe this isn't needed,
       what with the new interface protocol and all.)

      Mark some more strings for translation. The sort methods aren't
       being translated right now.

      Download whole directories with the push of a button. The files
       would be saved in a seperate directory in completed/.

UNLIKELY STUFF
--------------

      World domination and so on.

      Client to client chat.

      Use readline(3) for the input fields. This is probably not a good
       idea, and not even needed anymore.

Never forget, we must fight the feature creep!
