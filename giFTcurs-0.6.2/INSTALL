GENERIC INSTALLATION
--------------------

To  compile  giFTcurs  you need to have the development headers for ncurses
and glib-2.0  installed.  pkg-config  is  also  required.  If  glib-2.0  is
installed  in  a  non-standard location, you might need to set the PKG_CON­
FIG_PATH environment variable to the directory where glib-2.0.pc  is.  When
you've untarred the sources, cd into the source directory and type:

     ./configure
     make
     su
     make install

If  things  went well you should be able to run giFTcurs and connect to the
giFT daemon. If you don't have giFT, look at http://giftproject.org/.

CONFIGURE FLAGS
---------------

Here are some flags you can pass to configure in order to enable or disable
features, or change what libraries are used:

--with-ncurses[=dir]

     Build with ncurses. If dir is specified, the configure script will try
     to use the ncurses library in that directory.

--with-ncursesw[=dir]

     Build with ncursesw. The configure script will check  if  the  wadd_ch
     function is available and in that case enable UTF-8 support.

--disable-libgpm

     By  default  the  configure  script will look for libgpm, to get mouse
     support in the Linux console. This flag turns off this check.

--disable-mouse

     This flag turns off mouse support. This flag exists just so that  peo­
     ple who don't need mouse support will get a smaller binary.

--disable-internal-mouse

     If mouse support is enabled, it will by default be handled by routines
     built-in to giFTcurs. This internal mouse support can use  libgpm  and
     xterm mouse codes, but it will not work with e.g. OS/2 terminals.

There  are more flags you can pass to configure. Use the --help flag to get
a list.

INSTALLATION IN CYGWIN
----------------------

To install giFTcurs for cygwin, you will need to download and install glib.
Browse  http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~s01397ms/cygwin/ and download the latest
version of glib, and unpack it in cygwin's root  directory.  Provided  that
the version is 2.2.1-2, the following will do this:

     wget http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~s01397ms/cygwin/glib-2.2.1-2.tar.gz \
      -O - | tar -C / -xvzf -

Now follow the instructions in the GENERIC INSTALLATION section.

INSTALLATION ON DEBIAN GNU/LINUX 3.0
------------------------------------

GLib  2 isn't available for Debian GNU/Linux 3.0, so you'll need to install
it. It's rather annoying to build this yourself, since the glib2.0  package
needs pkg-config to build, and vice versa. For your convenience, there's an
APT repository  at  this  location,  that  has  woody  backports  of  gift,
giftcurs, glib2.0 and pkg-config:

     deb http://fnord.csbnet.se/giftcurs stable main
     deb-src http://fnord.csbnet.se/giftcurs stable main

Just  put these two lines in /etc/apt/sources.list, run apt-get update, and
then apt-get install gift.

INSTALLATION ON DEBIAN TESTING AND SID
--------------------------------------

giFTcurs is already available in Debian testing and sid, just  run  apt-get
install giftcurs.

INSTALLATION ON NETBSD 1.6
--------------------------

giFTcurs  has  been  tested and found working on NetBSD 1.6.1. The system's
curses library will work,  but  it's  recommended  that  you  use  ncurses.
Install  the  ncurses, glib2, and pkgconfig packages. For configure to find
ncurses, you might need to run it like this:

     ./configure --with-ncurses=/usr/pkg/

Now you can follow the instructions in the GENERIC INSTALLATION section.

INSTALLATION ON AMIGAOS
-----------------------

At least AmigaOS v3.0 is needed, and  to  compile  giFTcurs  you  need  gcc
2.95.3+  with  ixemul.library. It has been tested with AmigaOS v3.5 running
on a 68060 with ixemul v48.2.

To get giFTcurs to show  correctly,  you  should  use  the  terminfo  entry
amiga-8bit.

You  can (soon) download a precompiled version of giFTcurs for AmigaOS from
http://amiga.sf.net/. It has not yet been uploaded  at  the  time  of  this
writing.
