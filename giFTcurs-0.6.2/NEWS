	* A SIGBUS error on sparc64 was fixed.

New in 0.6.1, released 2003-08-31:
	* The 'Start search' button doesn't automatically clear old
	  searches, since some networks return more results when searched
	  multiple times.
	* Some annoying bugs regarding interface protocol ID's were fixed.

New in 0.6.0, released 2003-07-10:
	* Now uses GLib 2.
	* The md5file option is now deprecated, since giFT verifies the

	* Banned words are stored in the config file.
	* A user ignore feature. Press 'i' to ignore them for the session,
	  press 'I' to ignore them permanently.
	* A console where all messages are shown. Pressing 'v' will turn
	  on verbose mode. Pressing 'w' changes wrapping.
	* The search tab is highlighted when a search completes, and the
	  same goes for the transfer tab when a download completes.
	* A small interface protocol change is supported. giFT now uses
	  only the ID's in the range 32768-65535, to avoid ID collisions.
