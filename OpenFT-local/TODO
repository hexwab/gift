Probably quite a lot more left to do that isn't listed here.  If you wish to
implement any of these please contact the authors for advice on how to
proceed, otherwise you may be surprised when your patch is rejected.

Design:

  * Automatic node promotion.
  * New transfer protocol, considering using BitTorrent...
  * Notify search nodes when unusual download problems occur, encourage search
    node to re-evaluate port information.
  * New stats management system.
  * Separate ft_search_request into token query and md5 query.
  * Introduce a transparent routing layer so that PUSH requests do not need
    an additional TCP connection to the search node.

Code:

  * Add bandwidth tracking diagnostic systems to gauge bw scalability.
  * Remove ft_utils.c.
