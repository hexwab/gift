This includes a SoulSeek for giFT (http://giftproject.org). Hopefully this will make the
SoulSeek protocol widely available on Linux (and other platforms people wish to port this
to).

Compilation & Installation
--------------------------

First put the sources you got somewhere outside the giFT source tree.

Then run './autogen.sh' in the top source dir.

Mac OS X users should run sh -c 'LIBTOOL=glibtool LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize ./autogen.sh'
(or if use fink to install it, if you have it)

The next step is to run 'make' and 'make install' which will compile
and install the plugin.

Finally add 'SoulSeek' to your gift.conf file like so:

old: 'plugins = OpenFT:FastTrack'
new: 'plugins = OpenFT:FastTrack:SoulSeek'


There is currently one configure option, --disable-ltdl, if you do not
want to build libtool libs.


Common Problems
---------------

As a general rule, if you get errors that aren't mentioned below, first get
fresh sources from cvs before trying anything else. It may be that something
about giFT has changed and we fixed it in cvs but haven't released yet.

Problem:  You're using an outdated version of automake.
Symptoms: During ./autogen.sh you get errors like:
          "automake: src/Makefile.am: not supported: source file `crypt/fst_crypt.c' is in subdirectory"
Solution: Update to automake 1.5 or higher.
          For example, on Debian do a 'apt-get intsall automake1.5'

Problem:  You put the plugin into the giFT source tree.
Symptoms: During ./autogen.sh you get the error:
          "libtoolize failed to generate ltmain.sh"
Solution: Move the plugin somewhere outside the giFT source tree.

The foundation of the project is based on giFT-FastTrack. I basically copied everything from giFT-FastTrack
and started working and modifying from there. Thanks to the giFT-FastTrack developers for going through
that stage before me.
