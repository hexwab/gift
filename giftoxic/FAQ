	Q I'm getting "macro 'AM_PATH_GTK_2_0' not found in library" when
	  running autogen.sh. How can I get rid of this error?

	  you installed pkg-config in.

	
	Q giFToxic doesn't compile, I only get a weird error!

	A Update giFT and try again. If that doesn't fix your problem,
	  report a bug.

2.) RUNTIME

	Q giFToxic tells me I need to specify a host and port to connect to,
	  how do I do that?

	  giFToxic --server=127.0.0.1:1213


	Q I can't see umlauts or other special characters in search results
	  or transfers!

	A Set LC_CTYPE to a locale that supports those characters!


	Q giFToxic segfaults if I ...

	A Please send us (see AUTHORS) a GDB backtrace so we can see what's
	  going on. Run "gdb giFToxic" and when it crashes, type "bt" and send
	  us the output.
