giFToxic, a GPL'ed GTK2 based GUI for giFT
Copyright (C) 2002, 2003 giFToxic team (see AUTHORS)

If you want to comment on giFToxic, you're welcome to send an e-mail to <tsauerbeck@users.sourceforge.net>
Questions/comments/whatever regarding development of giFToxic can also be sent to our mailing list <giftoxic-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>


Installation
------------

See INSTALL.

giFToxic needs GTK+ 2.0 or GTK+ 2.2 and libgiFT (ships with giFT).

If it doesn't compile, first try to update giFT before mailing us.


How to use it
-------------

When giFToxic is started without the --server parameter, it tries to
read ~/.giFT/ui/ui.conf to get the server and port where the giFT
daemon it should connect to is running.
If giFToxic is told to connect to the local machine and that connection
attempt fails, the giFT daemon will be spawned.

Searching: nothing special. When using "-" as the first character of your
search token, hits that contain that token will be ignored.
Downloading: Right-click a file to download.

You can cancel a download by right-clicking and choosing "cancel". Pause/resume works the same way.

"Browse user's files" and user search doesn't work yet - it's a bug in giFT,
not in giFToxic!

If something doesn't work, please have a look at the FAQ before mailing
the developers.
