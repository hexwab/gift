      <ul>
        <li><b><em>What is giFT?</em></b><br />
        giFT is a plugin system that can be used to connect to many different networks. But for now
        OpenFT is the only network you can use. More information about the giFT project is in the
        <a href="http://gift.sourceforge.net/docs.php?document=whatis.html">What is the giFT
        project?</a> document. If you want to write a plugin for other networks (Gnutella,
        OpenNAP), please contact us.</li>

        <li><b><em>And, is it usable already?</em></b><br />
        Yes it is, very usable, but also very unstable. If you want to help us finding bugs, and
        you promise to update your copy daily, you may use it.</li>

        <li><b><em>Why must I keep my copy up to date?</em></b><br />
        Mostly because of OpenFT (see below). The way the network works changes a lot, and you can
        significantly pollute the network if you fail to update. Please keep a close eye on the
        CVS, and update daily, or at least once every three days.</li>

        <li><b><em>Well then, how do I install and use giFT?</em></b><br />
        That question is pretty much what the <a href= 
        "http://gift.sourceforge.net/docs.php?document=install.html">Installation Guide</a> is all
        about... go read it.</li>

        <li><b><em>Does giFT work on [platform]?</em></b><br />
        giFT/OpenFT works on several platform. See the doc/ directory for installation instructions
        for Windows and MacOS X.</li>

        <li><b><em>Why are you against the distributing of binaries?</em></b><br />
        giFT isn&#39;t ready for that. And if you&#39;re unable to build it yourself, it&#39;s not
        for you. We don&#39;t want lots different and incompatible version floating around, because
        they pollute our current test network.</li>

        <li><b><em>So, when do you release?</em></b><br />
        When it&#39;s done. Once all feature users will want are implemented and all bugs are
        squashed, and all documentation is up to date... then we&#39;ll probably release. This
        could take a few weeks, it could take it few months. Just keep checking :-).</li>

        <li><b><em>Why do you use a daemon?</em></b><br />
        It creates an easy way for people to focus their time on frontends instead of all of so
        much networking code. Also, if the daemon changes, all of the frontends will still function
        the same as they had before. This also makes it so we don&#39;t end up with 20 incompatible
        protocols flying around as standalone clients.</li>

        <li><b><em>Why the funny/boring/strange name?</em></b><br />
        That&#39;s kind of historical. When giFT was still related to FastTrack (see below), it
        used to mean &#39;generic interface to FastTrack&#39; (explains the capitalization) or
        &#39;giFT isn&#39;t FastTrack&#39;. A while after we moved away from FastTrack, and started
        developing OpenFT, &quot;nobody&quot; on the forums suggested to change the name to
        &#39;GNU Internet File Transfer&#39;, and we liked it, so we changed the name. A while
        after that, the name was changed again, because we aren&#39;t really a GNU project, to
        &#39;giFT: Internet File Transfer&#39;, and so it will probably stay...</li>

        <li><b><em>How did this all begin?</em></b><br />
        Development to create a Linux client to KaZaA was our initial goal. After a lot of reverse
        engineering and packet sniffing, a group of talented developers which became known as
        &quot;the givers&quot; stumbled onto our project (at the time &quot;kazaatux&quot;).<br />
        Within a few weeks, we had a working daemon that could connect to and search the KaZaA
        network. Shortly after, KaZaA released a new version of their client which eventually led
        to the breaking of what we now call giFT.<br />
        After the permanent departure of the givers, the giFT team started moving development into
        a new direction; foremost was the desire to have a completely open, completely free peer to
        peer network modeled in the image of FastTrack.<br />
        Thus OpenFT was born. giFT was moved to a new plugin architecture which would allow the
        creation of plugins that would make it easy for one client to be compatible with any number
        of networks. The first of these plugins were to be OpenFT.</li>

      <hr /><h2><a name="tth_sEc2">2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><b><em>Hey, giFT won&#39;t connect! (Before I updated it was fine)</em></b><br />
        Aha, first of all, you mean <em>OpenFT</em> won&#39;t connect. Secondly, the difference
        between the current version you&#39;re running and your previous version is a major
        protocol change. Because OpenFT is still under heavy development newer versions of the
        protocol are not backwards compatible. Removing your nodes file will usually help. (See the
        &#39;nodes file&#39; section of the <a href= 
        "http://gift.sourceforge.net/docs.php?document=install.html">Installation Guide</a> for
        more information).</li>

        <li><b><em>Huh? Where did all those users go? (Before I updated there were tons of
        &#39;em)</em></b><br />
        Like the previous question, this probably has to do with an OpenFT protocol change. If all
        our users would update daily, this wouldn&#39;t be a problem. The only solution is to be
        patient (and helping us with telling users why they should update daily ;-).</li>

        <li><b><em>Aargh, giFT crashed! What now?</em></b><br />
        You&#39;ve most likely found a bug. Make sure you&#39;re using the most recent CVS version
        (it could have been fixed already), and know how to use gdb (GNU Debugger). It&#39;s wise
        to <a href="http://wand.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~dhtrl1/pl5/gdb.html">do</a> <a href= 
        "http://web.mit.edu/sipb-iap/unixsoftdev/www/gdb.html">some</a> <a href= 
        "http://users.actcom.co.il/~choo/lupg/tutorials/debugging/debugging-with-gdb.html">homework</a>
        prior to reporting bugs. Otherwise, you probably won&#39;t be very helpful. (Note: the
        &#39;homework&#39; pages aren&#39;t directly applicable to giFT, but meant to learn to use
        gdb.)</li>

        <li><b><em>Help! Why does giFT almost bring my system to a halt?</em></b><br />
        Ah, you&#39;re running giFT for the first time... giFT is calculating the md5sum (this
        process is called &#39;hashing&#39;) of all your shared files to create a database. The
        next time you run giFT only files that were added or changed will be hashed.</li>

        <li><b><em>Hmm, I get strange errors when trying to install, what&#39;s up?</em></b><br />
        Most likely you haven&#39;t read the <a href= 
        "http://gift.sourceforge.net/docs.php?document=install.html">Installation Guide</a>.
        You&#39;ll have to read it anyway, but the thing that usually works is making sure the
        needed software is up to date (and updating it if it isn&#39;t). Make sure you have
        autoconf 2.5x, automake 1.4 and libtool 1.4.x. And read the damn <a href= 
        "http://gift.sourceforge.net/docs.php?document=install.html">Installation Guide</a></li>

      <ul>
        <li><b><em>How can I help speed up development?</em></b><br />
        Use your special skills! If you can code, design a nifty GUI or are specialized in Public
        Relations, or whatever, drop into our IRC channel and ask what <em>you</em> can do. Also,
        clear bugreports, patches and more documentation are welcome.</li>

        <li><b><em>I&#39;ve got an idea! What if...</em></b><br />
        You&#39;re not the first one. If you want to discuss your idea or the way giFT/OpenFT
        works, please <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gift-openft">subscribe
        to gift-openft@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</li>

        <li><b><em>Will giFT be ported to any other hosts?</em></b><br />
        The program was initially designed for Linux, but the recent version compiles on *BSD,
        Solaris, OS X, and Windows (natively) too. You&#39;re always welcome to port giFT to your
        platform of choice. Please contact us if you&#39;re successful.</li>

        <li><b><em>Front-end Developers</em></b><br />
        See the <a href="http://gift.sourceforge.net/docs.php?document=interface.html">Interface
        Protocol Documentation</a>. There are already quite a few clients available, <a href= 
        "http://gift.sourceforge.net/dev/clients.php">our client page</a> lists the ones that work.
        Searching for &#39;giFT&#39; on SourceForge will find you some more giFT related projects.
        Please check first if you can help an other project, before starting your own.</li>

        <li><b><em>I want to make an OpenFT client!</em></b><br />
        No, you don&#39;t. You want to make a giFT client. Through giFT, OpenFT can be used.
        Otherwise you&#39;ll have to include a framework just like giFT in your client, and that
        would be like reinventing the wheel. Please read <a href= 
        "http://gift.sourceforge.net/docs.php?document=whatis.html">What is the giFT project?</a>
        for more info.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><b><em>What&#39;s this OpenFT I&#39;ve been hearing about?</em></b><br />
        It&#39;s an Open Source &quot;clone&quot; of FastTrack being worked on by the giFT project.
        We welcome anyone with decentralized/p2p experience to drop by and poke around at our
        design.</li>

        <li><b><em>Can I use OpenFT without giFT?</em></b><br />
        Yes, if you write a framework for it, like giFT. So, the real answer is: no. If you&#39;re
        still convinced you want to write a new framework, maybe even in an other language than C,
        like Java, C# or whatever, please contact us, and we&#39;ll talk you out of it.</li>

        <li><b><em>Is there documentation available on how OpenFT works?</em></b><br />
        No, but the source code is pretty readable :-). The main problem is to find someone
        motivated enough to write this document, if you want to do it, contact us through <a href= 
        "http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gift-openft">the mailing list</a>.</li>

        <li><b><em>Hey, I can download files with my browser from OpenFT hosts, is OpenFT a
        webserver?</em></b><br />
        Uh, no. OpenFT uses an incomplete implementation of the HTTP protocol for file transfers
        from non-firewalled hosts. Theoretically you can use it as a webserver for static files,
        but if you do so, you&#39;ve missed the point :-)</li>

        <li><b><em>What is this &quot;FastTrack&quot;?</em></b><br />
        FastTrack is the company that licenses the library that KaZaA/Grokster (Morpheus uses
        Gnutella now) operates off of</li>

        <li><b><em>What&#39;s your connection with FastTrack?</em></b><br />
        giFT 0.9.x used the FastTrack network. FastTrack changed the encryption, end of story.
        Since October 2001 we&#39;ve been fully focused on the &quot;new&quot; giFT and OpenFT.
        <b>Don&#39;t</b> ask us for a FastTrack client, just forget about it.</li>

        <li><b><em>Are you working on getting back into FastTrack&#39;s network?</em></b><br />
        No. Although quite a few people made attempts to reverse engineer the new encryption,
        nobody has succeeded, and nobody is working on it anymore because OpenFT kicks so much ass
        nobody even remembers FastTrack.</li>
