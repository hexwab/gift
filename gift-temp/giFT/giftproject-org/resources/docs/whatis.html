      <hr /><h2><a name="tth_sEc1">1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;About this document</h2>
      Many people are puzzled about the structure of the giFT project. Questions such as &quot;What
      is giFT?&quot; and &quot;What is OpenFT?&quot; are not easily answered. This document will
      try to make everything clear. For generic questions, or questions more vaguely related to the
      giFT project, you should read the <a href= 
      "http://gift.sourceforge.net/docs.php?document=faq.html">FAQ</a> instead.

      <hr /><h2><a name="tth_sEc2">2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is giFT?</h2>
      giFT is like a &#39;bridge&#39;. It&#39;s a daemon (a program that runs in the background
      without active Input/Output) that can handle multiple file sharing protocols. The protocols
      will be dynamically loaded as a sort of &#39;plugin&#39;. That&#39;s one side of the bridge.

          </center>

          <div class="p">
            The other side of the bridge is a simple interface protocol, which provides the
            frontend (also called &#39;GUI&#39; or &#39;interface&#39;) a unified method to work
            with all file sharing protocols. In the near future we will also provide a clean C API
            for communicating with the giFT daemon via libgift so that knowledge of the specific
            protocol or even network programming in general will not be required.

            <hr /><h2><a name="tth_sEc3">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is OpenFT?</h2>
            OpenFT is a file sharing protocol developed by the giFT project. It is loosely based on
            the idea of FastTrack, working in a different way to well-known file sharing programs
            like Napster and Gnutella.
          </div>

          <div class="p">
            Napster (and OpenNap) work with one server providing users a way to share files and
            search for files from other users, in a big list. This requires constantly running
            servers, and bringing the network down is as easy as shutting those (few) servers down.
            Also, those servers must be able to handle thousands of connections, and must have lots
            of memory and disk space to maintain and search the filelists.
          </div>

          <div class="p">
            Gnutella creates a structure of &#39;nodes&#39; (computers connected to the network),
            with every node connecting to a few others. Search requests must be forwarded through
            the whole network (or at least a large part of it). Because of this, Gnutella uses a
            lot of bandwidth, and it can take a long time to recieve search requests.
          </div>

                  Figure 2: Napster and Gnutella
                </center>

                <div class="p">
                  OpenFT combines the idea of Napster and Gnutella, making a network of nodes
                  connected to each other, but with certain nodes having specific tasks. There are
                  3 different kind of nodes. 

                  <ul>
                    <li>USER<br />
                    The &#39;normal&#39; nodes are USER nodes, they don&#39;t have any special
                    function.</li>

                    <li>SEARCH<br />
                    These nodes handle search requests. They search the filelists their CHILD nodes
                    (explained below) submitted to them. These nodes must have a capable Internet
                    connection and at least 128M RAM. A modern processor is highly recommended as
                    well.</li>

                    <li>INDEX<br />
                    Nodes with a fast connection and lots of memory should be INDEX nodes. INDEX
                    nodes keep lists of available search nodes, collect statistics, and try to
                    maintain the structure of the network.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="p">
                  A node can be both a SEARCH and a INDEX node.
                </div>

                <div class="p">
                  USER nodes will pick three SEARCH nodes to be their PARENT nodes. They&#39;ll
                  submit their shares list to them if the PARENT accepts the USER as its CHILD. By
                  default, SEARCH nodes will be PARENTS for a maximum of 500 CHILD nodes.
                </div>

                        For more technical information about OpenFT, you must read the source code,
                        because there&#39;s no document covering that at the moment. Also, you can
                        use <a href="http://doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> to generate documentation from
                        comments in the source files, using doxygen/doxygen.conf in the CVS
                        repository.

                      <div class="p">
                        When we (members of the giFT project) say &#39;OpenFT&#39;, we can mean two
                        different things. First, there is the OpenFT <b>protocol</b>, but
                        there&#39;s also OpenFT as an <b>implementation</b> in the form of a plugin
                        for giFT. Keep that in mind.
                      </div>

                        <hr /><h2><a name="tth_sEc4">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the relation between giFT
                        and OpenFT?</h2>
                        This is a frequently misunderstood issue. As you know, if you&#39;ve read
                        the document this far, giFT and OpenFT are two different projects started
                        by the giFT project. That&#39;s about the only thing they have in common.
                      </div>

                      <div class="p">
                        giFT is a program that works like a &#39;bridge&#39;.<br />
                        OpenFT is a network protocol <b>and</b> a plugin for giFT, implementing the
                        OpenFT protocol.
                      </div>

                      <div class="p">
                        Because both giFT and OpenFT were developed by the giFT project, and the
                        programs are distributed together, we often call it
                        &quot;giFT/OpenFT&quot;. If giFT gets a OpenNap plugin, giFT together with
                        that plugin (probably) will be called giFT/OpenNap.
                      </div>

                      <div class="p">
                        If you referrer to giFT/OpenFT just as &quot;OpenFT&quot; you&#39;re
                        incorrect. For instance, we had people coming to us, claiming they wanted
                        to implement OpenFT, when they actually meant they wanted to write a
                        frontend for giFT, to use OpenFT.
                      </div>

                      <div class="p">
                        When you want to share files on OpenFT, you&#39;ll have to do that
                        <b>through</b> giFT. That means you tell giFT what files you want to share,
                        and giFT will pass that info to the different plugins. Similary for
                        searching, downloading, etc.

                        to giFT?</h2>
                        giFT offers the frontend a unified way to communicate with OpenFT and other
                        file sharing protocols. This way you can make a frontend and only have to
                        teach it one &#39;trick&#39;, namely using and understanding the giFT
                        interface protocol.

                      <div class="p">
                        For more information about this protocol, read the <a href=

                        giFT relies on third party frontends. Luckily, quite a few already exist. A

                        to OpenFT?</h2>
                        Hah! There is none! A frontend doesn&#39;t have to know anything about
                        OpenFT, and it must use giFT for communicating with it. There is no way for
                        a frontend to communicate directly with OpenFT, because you&#39;ll have to
                        implement everything that giFT does into it, to achieve that. And that
                        would be rather silly, wouldn&#39;t it?
