This document describes building a Windows self extracting executable (SFX)
using NullSoft's SuperPimp NSIS installer.

For information on building giFT using Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0, please 
see INSTALL.msvc++.

Download NSIS from http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/#download
The latest version, as of this writing, is: 
http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/nsis20b1.exe

Install NSIS and add the installation directory to your system PATH.

First, build the giFT executables using either method outlined in INSTALL.msvc++.

If you wish to include giftcurs, install Cygwin, and build giftcurs within it.

If you used Makefile.msvc, then type the following:

$ cd win32
$ mkdir Debug
$ cp ../src/*.exe ../ui/*.exe Debug

Next, type the following:

$ cd win32
$ ./copydocs.sh

This will add CR's to several files included in the SFX, as NSIS requires
the files to contain CR's.

Next, edit win32/gift.nsi, and change any paths as necessary.
Also change the GIFT_DATE to reflect the date the build was generated.

Finally, in Windows, type the following:

> cd win32
> makensis.exe gift.nsi

This will create the SFX, giFT-0.10.0-cvs.exe
