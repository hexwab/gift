Please note that some of this isn't really meant to make sense to anyone but
jasta.


giFT:

   . doxygen the entire project
   . update documentation

OpenFT:

   . add bandwidth tracking diagnostic systems to gauge bw scalability
   . automatic node promotion

     node to re-evaluate port information.
