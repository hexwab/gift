 * A design flaw in download.c regarding chunk and source associations causes
   transfers without sources to fail to deliver the p->download_stop call to
   plugins.  This usually results in a segfault when the Transfer object is
   directly referenced when the state of the plugin transfer changes.

 * No fail-safe handler is present when the giFT host fails to write the state
   file (usually because there's no space left).  This means that unless you
   close the daemon, free up space, and start again you will produce a
   slightly corrupted download.  Specifically you will have holes in the
   sparse file where no data was written.
