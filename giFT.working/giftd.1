.TH giFT 1 "13 April 2003" "giFT version 0.10.0"
.SH NAME
giftd \- Daemon component for the giFT project
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR giFT " [ " options "... ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B giftd
is a modular deamon capable of abstracting the communication between the end
user and specific filesharing protocols (peer-to-peer or otherwise).  This
giFT daemon is the main core of the system, but will not be useful without a
controlling interface (known as a giFT client or interface) and a protocol
plugin.
.P
Please note that the bulk of the run-time options are controlled through the
daemon and plugin configuration files.  See the
.BR FILES
section for more information.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -h ", " --help
Show a short overview of all options
.TP
.BR -V ", " --version
Output version information and exit.
.TP
.BR -d ", " --daemon
Fork to the background as a daemon would.
.TP
.BR -x ", " --index-only
Update the shares database and exit
.TP
.BR -o<VAL> ", " --opt=<VAL>
Run-time configuration override.  The format of the value string is as
follows:

plugin:/group/key=value

For example, if you wish to change OpenFT's lan_mode switch via this
interface, you would use:

openft:/local/lan_mode=1
.TP
.BR -p<VAL> ", " --protocol=<VAL>
Load the specified plugin (overrides
.BR giftd.conf (5)).
from file.  Plugins specified here can be treated as a single member in
gift:/main/plugins.  You may specify this option multiple times on the command
line.
.TP
.BR -q ", " --quiet
Disable logging entirely.  Overrides -v and -l.
.TP
.BR -v ", " --verbose
Increase the verbosity level (default=0).  Currently, the only meaningful
level is 1, where all output will be printed to the normal log facility, as
well as to stderr.  If you wish to change the default logging path to stderr
only, you should use -v in conjunction with -l/dev/null.
.TP
.BR -l<VAL> ", " --logfile=<VAL>
Use the log path specified by <VAL> instead of the default ~/.giFT/giftd.log.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ~/.giFT/giftd.conf
Generic configuration for giFT, see
.BR giftd.conf (5)
for more information
.TP
.I ~/.giFT/giftd.log
Debug information. A clean file is used every startup.
.TP
.I ~/.giFT/access.log
Apache-style access log. Can be used to generate fancy statistics, although
it's not very reliable. (Often only chunks of files have been downloaded from
you.)
.TP
.I ~/.giFT/shares
Share database containing all cached meta and hashing data about your shares.
Removal of this file will force a clean rebuild of all this data.
.SH BUGS
.B giFT
is currently development software.  This means that the stability of the
project cannot always be guaranteed, and as such we strongly encourage
constructive debugging feedback that will help us mature the project as best
we can.  Please consult the documentation available at
http://www.giftproject.org/ so that you might use the proper channels
requested by the development staff.
