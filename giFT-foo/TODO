Documentation:

  * update documentation :)

Design:

  * add an HTTP/HTML default web interface built into the daemon that can
    be used to supplement the features not provided by the interface protocol
  * allow for greater control of giFT behaviour from plugins, including
    the ability to control multi-source transfer chunk boundaries

Code:

  * switch to the newly introduced BOOL libgift type
  * doxygen the entire project
  * improve mime support using mime.magic
  * fair upload queue
  * transfer system rewrite (pending in jasta's local source tree, but not
    yet completed)

    UNIX:

      * test for fork's presence and implement a blocking platform_child_proc
        if it's nowhere to be found.

    Windows:

      * add code (in win32/) to run giFT as an NT/2000/XP service.
