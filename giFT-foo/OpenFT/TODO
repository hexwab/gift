Probably quite a lot more left to do that isn't listed here.  If you wish to
implement any of these please contact the authors for advice on how to
proceed.

Design:

  * automatic node promotion
  * new transfer protocol, considering using BitTorrent...
  * notify search nodes when unusual download problems occur, encourage search
    node to re-evaluate port information.
  * new stats management system
  * separate ft_search_request into token query and md5 query

Code:

  * add bandwidth tracking diagnostic systems to gauge bw scalability
  * remove ft_utils.c
  * remove ft_shost.c and replace with direct FTNode links in ft_search_db.c
