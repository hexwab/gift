This is a placeholder document that will eventually be filled with a detailed
description of the OpenFT network, as well as a possible guideline for
implementation, although alternate implementations are very much so against
this projects wishes.  If you feel compelled to do something like this, please
contact the developers.  Keep in mind that this is not an open invitation to
spam us with poorly thought out feature ideas...

Note that this is still very low on my TODO list and any external help
with this document would be greatly appreciated.  Please be sure that your
motivation is sincere and that you will be able to see the project through to
completion.
