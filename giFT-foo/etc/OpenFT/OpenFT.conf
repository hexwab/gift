# MAIN

[main]

#
# Node classification.  This value is very important and will determine your
# potential role on the network.  The following settings are allowed:
#
# 1  (USER)
#
#  Basic class that all nodes implicitly belong to.  This node will maintain
#  very few TCP connections on the network and perform almost no tasks other
#  than to upload to other users.  Users who do not have direct Internet
#  connections will be forced into this class.
#
# 3  (SEARCH)
#
#  Responsible for manging indexes of a large group of directly connected
#  children (run-time modifier for the USER class), responding to and
#  forwarding search requests from peers, as well as directing push requests
#  so that indirectly connected users may still share files.
#
#  Please note that this class will require a much greater amount of both
#  local and network resources.  If you select this, pay very close attention
#  to the database environment settings several configuration options down.
#  For reference, there are several fully functioning search nodes on
#  "average" broadband connections, such as 768/128kbit (my node *sigh*).
#
#  Keeping your node up-to-date is absolutely essential for this node class.
#  Please consider updating at least once a week.
#
# 5  (INDEX)
#
#  Meta node used in favor of user nodes when attempting new connections to
#  the network.  This node class is also responsible for managing statistics
#  information for the virtual clusters created by SEARCH nodes.  Reliability
#  is the largest requirement here.
#
# If you're unsure it is highly recommended that you select 1 (the default).
# A setting of 7 will select both a SEARCH and INDEX node.
#
class = 1

#
# Core listening port.  OpenFT uses a compacted binary protocol for the core
# communication with other nodes.  If this machine is unable to provide both
# port and http_port to the outside directly (blocked by either by a firewall
# or a NAT setup) you should select 0 here.
#
# NOTE:
#  If you are unable to route this port (along with the HTTP port) you will be
#  unable to download from other users with that same inability.  You will,
#  however, maintain the ability to upload to other non-firewalled users.
#  Selecting non-zero when the port is not available to the outside will cause
#  very broken behaviour, namely search results will be extremely unreliable.
#
port = 1215

#
# HTTP server port.  OpenFT's implementation also makes use of HTTP for all
# file transfers.  See above for more details.  Please provide a valid port
# here regardless of your firewall state.
#
http_port = 1216

#
# Arbitrary name you'd like to associate with your node.  This field is
# optional and it is NOT to be trusted.  The name is not unique to the
# network.  Please do not choose useless aliases.

# NODEPAGE OPTIONS

[nodepage]

#
# If set non-zero, OpenFT will not allow remote hosts to access the nodepage.
# This option also depends on local/hosts_allow shown below.  For the
# interest of debugging I suggest you just leave this as is.
#
private = 0

###############################################################################
# SEARCH NODE SETTINGS

[search]

#
# Maximum number of "child" nodes you are able to support.  You should not
# touch this unless you know what you're doing.
#
# NOTE:
#  This option has no effect unless you configure as a SEARCH node.
#
children = 500

#
# Absolute path where the search database environment should be stored.  Make
# sure to provide a path with plenty of hard disk space (~100-300MB) and on a
# device with efficient hard drive access to improve access time when
# swapping cannot be avoided.
#
# NOTE:
#  As always, this path is in UNIX format, so Windows users will need to
#  hack around this accordingly.  If you aren't sure what I mean by this, you
#  need to go back and read gift.conf documentation.
#
env_path = ~/.giFT/OpenFT/db

#
# Total cache size for the entire search database environment.  The idea is
# to find a perfect balance here between disk access and memory usage, which
# we are still widely experimenting with.  If you have a lot of RAM to
# dedicate to your search node, by all means increase this number accordingly
# as it will improve overall performance.
#
# WARNING:
#  Specifications less than 500MB (and we expect you will specify less than
#  that) are subject to a 20% inflation due to some libdb implementation
#  detail.
#
# NOTE:
#  Units are specified in bytes, and as such you will not be allowed to
#  specify 1GB or higher.  While libdb supports this, the API is more obscure
#  than this simple configuration option, hopefully the configuration will
#  be extended at some point to support this.
#
env_cache = 83886080

#
# Controls whether or not the database environment is private.  If the
# database environment is private, you will be unable to use the database
# tools provided by the libdb util package.  This will make it almost to gain
# memory pool statistics for the entire process and makes tweaking of the
# search code almost impossible.  However, most users will want this turned
# on as it will create a rather large temporary swap file in the database
# directory otherwise.
#
env_priv = 0

###############################################################################
# LAN MODE FACILITIES

[local]

#
# OpenFT offers a special configuration for users who wish to operate a
# network from within a local area network (LAN).  This mode causes giFT to
# reject authorization from any non-local address as well as advertising it's
# presence via the local UDP broadcast.  If this switch is non-zero you will
# not be able to contact the main network.
#
lan_mode = 0

#
# When LAN mode is enabled, this configuration switch is used to verify
# which hosts are allowed connection to the core OpenFT port.  It is
# highly recommended that you just don't touch this, regardless of what
# lan_mode's value is.
#
# NOTE:
#  This switch provides a very crude loophole that could allow you to create
#  a "private" OpenFT network between a list of known nodes.  Using this
#  "feature" is going to be quite cumbersome as it is intended to be used
#  by developers only.  You have been warned.
#
#hosts_allow = LOCAL
