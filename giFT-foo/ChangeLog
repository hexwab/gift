giFT 0.10.0 (cvs):

   * giFT is now a completely different project.  The rest of the ChangeLog
     is provided for legacy purposes only.

giFT 0.9.7:

   * Information lost.

giFT 0.9.6:

   * Information lost.

giFT 0.9.5:

   * The library (libgiFT.a) now supports parallel downloading of files from
     peers.
   * The giFT daemon does not do the parallel download, but there is a new
     program (giFTget) which does. You can use it to see how to integrate
     parallel downloading into your own clients, or you can just use that one.
   * giFTget is now integrated with the CGI frontend (giFT.cgi) and a new
     helper application (giFTquerycgi) for a usable parallel-download mechanism
     for the CGI interface.

giFT 0.9.4:

   * File sharing now works! Other people can now search for and download our
     files. There's no limit yet on upload bandwidth or number of simultaneous
     connections, though. Next time.
   * You can specify what IP address to listen for connections from peers on
     with the -l option. Default is to listen on all addresses.
   * You can now search on any tag type, with any search type.

giFT 0.9.3:

   * We now advertise to supernodes the list of files we're sharing! If
     someone tries to connect to us to fetch the file, however, we'll just ignore
     them for now. The files have no metadata associated with them other than
     their filename. Handlers need to be written for specific file types in
     order to extract the correct metadata.
   * Terminology: the "hash" is the 16-byte cryptographic hash, plus the
     4-byte "short hash". The "checksum" is the 2-byte value that goes in the
     URL.
   * We can now do searches for a given hash value. Format: <search
     hash="ed22df40ef1e0b3f641f189936dfe7aefad99053"/>
   * We now advertise what port we're listening on for connections from
     peers, though we don't do anything with that socket yet.
   * The workaround below failed on slow connections. This version will wait
     longer for a response from the supernode.
   * If we get as far as trying to decrypt the session with the supernode,
     then if we disconnect (because, for example, some crypto bits happen to
     fail, or the net goes away temporarily, or whatever), then automatically
     try to reconnect.

giFT 0.9.2.2:

   * Worked around FT's "security update" which prevented giFT from working.
   * Did an extra sanity check when receiving packets.
   * Separated out FileDescription from FileEntry, for later use with
     the sharing protocol.

giFT 0.9.2.1:

   * Replaced the shell to wget with native code when fetching a new
     .giFTnodes file
   * All routines that touch the nodes file have been moved into nodes.c.
   * Made allow_probe into a runtime variable instead of a compile-time
     option. There's still no way to set it except by modifying the source at
     this time. Eventually, it will be a command-line option.
   * The sequence is now:
   * Read the .giFTnodes file
   * If there's nothing there, try to fetch a new one from the web
   * If there's still nothing, and allow_probes is set, probe
   * Realized the "usertag" is more likely an indication of
     bandwidth. But we're still not too sure about that.
   * Moved from kazaatux to gift.

giFT 0.9.2:

   * Fixed a bunch of free() calls that assumed that free(NULL) is a
     no-op, which isn't necessarily the case
   * Added support for giFT keeping track of supernode-reported statictics
     (packet type 0x09). These statistics are reported on the console, and can be
     queried by a client.
   * We're a little more careful with use of "const".
   * Changed the command line functionality. No more can you put IP
     addresses of nodes on the command line (put them in the .giFTnodes file
     instead). Now, there are options to control behavior.
   * Changed the peer-finding strategy if we run out of nodes to check. Now
     we fetch a .giFTnodes file from sourceforge. We also send that site our
     .giFTnodes file periodically.
   * Updated README file to reflect new peer-finding strategy, complex
     queries, and statistics
   * Sockets to giFT clients weren't non-blocking. Fixed.
   * Added support for packet type 0x09 (statistics)
   * We no longer probe 24.0.0.0/8 by default; instead, try to
     download a .giFTnodes file from some known URL
   * Reread the .giFTnodes file periodically, if it's been changed out from
     under us.
   * Listen for connections from peers on port 1214, but don't do anything
     with them just yet.

giFT 0.9.1:

   * We now send queries to all the supernodes we're connected to, not just
     one. We get a lot more (and different) results that way.
   * We now support complex search queries. The CGI interface has also been
     updated accordingly. The fact that there's supposed to be about 400TB of
     data on this network is much more apparent.

giFT 0.9.0:

   * Initial release to sourceforge.net
