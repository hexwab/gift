=======================================

Autogenerated documentation may be found on our main site (listed above), as
well as information on how to contact the development team (PLEASE READ BEFORE
CONTACTING ANYONE!).  If you have the tools necessary to build our docs from
the latex source you can also poke around in doc/src/.

Please make sure you read gift.log (usually in ~/.giFT/gift.log) when
attempting to diagnose giFT problems.
