/**
 * @file nb.h
 *
 * @brief Simplified non-blocking socket input
 *
 * NB is a system designed to assist in reading complete packets individually
 * when operating on a non-blocking socket.  These routines are designed to
 * be called from within a select () callback from the event system.  These
 * routines can also be used on blocking sockets by simply wrapping the
 * \ref nb_read function within a while loop.  See below for more info.
 *
 * Sample code:
 *
 * \code
 * void read_function (int fd)
 * {
 *     NBRead *nb;
 *
 *     // create a new nb structure or access a previous one using fd as the
 *     // unique key.
 *     nb = nb_active (fd);
 *
 *     // do not terminate until we see "\r\n"...
 *     if (nb_read_term (nb, "\r\n") < 0)
 *     {
 *         // handle disconnect
 *         nb_finish (nb);
 *         return;
 *     }
 *
 *     // the data will be terminated when nb_read is completely finished
 *     // reading.  do not process until then.
 *     if (!nb->term)
 *         return;
 *
 *     printf ("read '%s'...\n", nb->data);
 * }
 * \endcode
